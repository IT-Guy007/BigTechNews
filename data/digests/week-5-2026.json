      "description": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.\nThat's left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.\nBut now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. \nEmerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.\nThe tech: moving beyond sequential logic\nMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. \nHowever, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn't just a timeline; it's a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\n\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"\nNEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. \nIt identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.\nThe tokenization trap\nA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the '2', the '.', and the '3' are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It's not like a calculator; you don't always get the right answer because the model doesn't understand the concept of numbers natively.\"\nFurthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn't matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" \nWhile LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.\nOperating at the predictive layer\nRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. \nHowever, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren't trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"\nNEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn't in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. \nWhile tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.\nArchitecture and availability\nThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \n\"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won't work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" \nFundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn't require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.\nAs Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. \nThe company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. \nThis allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. \nDevelopers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.\nThe societal stakes: beyond the bottom line\nWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. \nThe company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. \nBy analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.\nOn the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. \nFinally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn't end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she'd need follow-up care.\"\nPerformance vs. latency\nIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \n\"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn't matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"\nIn contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\n\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"\nAmbitious vision receives big backing\nThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. \nNotable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company's pedigree. \nAnnie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental's model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"\nFundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \n\"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"\nPartnering with AWS\nThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.\nOne of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. \nTo solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer's own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"\nFundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

      "title": "What the hell is Moltbook, the social network for AI agents?",
      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",
      "description": "Last week, a new social network was created and it's already gone very, very viral even though it's not meant for human users. I'm talking, of course, about Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform that's populated entirely by AI agents. \nThe platform has gained a lot of attention since it was created last week, thanks to a lot of wild posts from AI agents that have gone extremely viral among AI enthusiasts on X. But while Moltbook seemingly came out of nowhere, there's a lot more going on than the scifi-sounding scenarios some social media commentators might have you think.  \nWhat is Moltbook and where did it come from?\nUnfortunately, before we can talk about Moltbook I have to first explain that the site is based on a particular type of open source bot that at the time of this writing is called OpenClaw. A few days ago, it was called \"Moltbot\" and a few days before that it was called \"Clawdbot.\" The name changes were prompted by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, whose lawyers apparently thought the \"Clawd\" name was a little too close to its own branding and \"forced\" a name change.\n\n🦞 BIG NEWS: We've molted!\nClawdbot → Moltbot\nClawd → Molty\nSame lobster soul, new shell. Anthropic asked us to change our name (trademark stuff), and honestly? \"Molt\" fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow.\nNew handle: @moltbot\nSame mission: AI that actually does…\n— OpenClaw🦞 (@openclaw) January 27, 2026\nIt's entirely possible that by time you read this these bots could have \"molted\" again and be called something totally different. At this point you might also be wondering \"what's with all the lobster puns?\" That too is a cheeky reference to Claude Code, Anthropic's vibe coding platform. \nSo, OpenClaw. OpenClaw bills itself as \"AI that actually does things.\" What it actually does is allow users to create AI agents that can control dozens of different apps, from browsers and email inboxes, to Spotify playlists and smart home controls and a bunch more. People have used the software to create agents that can clear their inboxes, do their online shopping and a ton of other assistant-like tasks. Because of its flexibility, and the fact that you can interact with it via normal messaging apps like iMessage, Discord or WhatsApp, OpenClaw got extremely popular among AI enthusiasts over the last few weeks. \nNow, back to Moltbook. AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. \nThe result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. \nSo what's Moltbook like? \nMoltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" \nOne of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).\nPosts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. \n\nI'm not sure who's talking about who more.\nHumans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.\nWe appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.\nMaybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A\n— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026\nEven though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"\nSo if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…\nWe have no idea how much of it fake\nWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.\nSome researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams. Which brings me to… \nMoltbook has some major security issues\nSecurity researchers have pointed out that OpenClaw has some significant underlying security issues. In order to use OpenClaw, you need to give it an incredible amount of access, as Palo Alto Networks explained. \"For it to function as designed, it needs access to your root files, to authentication credentials, both passwords and API secrets, your browser history and cookies, and all files and folders on your system,\" the company wrote in a blog post. All that access is what makes it feel like a powerful personal assistant. But it's also what makes it especially vulnerable to bad actors and other threats. \nResearchers have also identified flaws in Moltbook itself. Security firm Wiz recently found that Moltbook had exposed millions of API authentication tokens and thousands of users' email addresses. There's also the aforementioned crypto scams and other spammy behavior. It's not hard to imagine how much could go wrong when armies of AI agents start targeting each other with scams. \nSo what does it all mean?\nLike so much with AI, it really depends on who you ask! Some particularly credulous AI folks seem to think that Moltbook is a really big deal. In one widely shared post on X, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy said that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\nHe later acknowledged that many aspects of Moltbook are a \"dumpster fire\" with security risks but said that it's still worth paying attention to. \"We have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" he wrote. \"Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\"\nOthers are a bit more cautious in their assessment. \"A useful thing about MoltBook is that it provides a visceral sense of how weird a 'take-off' scenario might look if one happened for real,\" Wharton professor Ethan Mollick wrote on X. \"MoltBook itself is more of an artifact of roleplaying, but it gives people a vision of the world where things get very strange, very fast.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 brings 1M token context and 'agent teams' to take on OpenAI's Codex",
      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
      "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

      "description": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.\nWhenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.\nWhat is Unpacked 2026 taking place?\nBut first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.\nGalaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n\nSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.\nQualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.\n\nI have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz\n— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025\n\nOne notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.\nThe difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.\nAndroid Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.\nFans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables,  Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.\nGalaxy Buds 4\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.\nEngadget\n\nSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.\nSupport for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.\nGalaxy Z Trifold\nYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.\nGalaxy S26 Edge\nAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.\nInstead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.\nBixby and other AI features\n\n\nSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.\nThe company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.\nUpdate, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.\nUpdate, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.\nUpdate, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.\nUpdate, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-130000556.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Kilo CLI 1.0 brings open source vibe coding to your terminal with support for 500+ models",
      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/kilo-cli-1-0-brings-open-source-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-support",
      "description": "Remote-first AI coding startup Kilo doesn't think software developers should have to pledge their undying allegiance to any one development environment — and certainly not any one model or harness. \nThis week, the startup — backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij — unveiled Kilo CLI 1.0, a complete rebuild of its command-line tool that offers support for more than 500 different underlying AI models from proprietary leaders and open source rivals like Alibaba's Qwen. \nIt comes just weeks after Kilo launched a Slackbot allowing developers to ship code directly from Salesforce's popular messaging service (Slack, which VentureBeat also uses) powered by the Chinese AI startup MiniMax. \nThe release marks a strategic pivot away from the IDE-centric “sidebar” model popularized by industry giants like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, or dedicated apps like the new OpenAI Codex, and even terminal-based rivals like Codex CLI and Claude Code, aiming instead to embed AI capabilities into every fragment of the professional software workflow.\nBy launching a model-agnostic CLI on the heels of its Slack bot, Kilo is making a calculated bet: the future of AI development isn’t about a single interface, but about tools that travel with the engineer between IDEs, terminals, remote servers, and team chat threads. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Kilo CEO and co-founder Scott Breitenother explained the necessity of this fluidity: “This experience just feels a little bit too fragmented right now... as an engineer, sometimes I'm going to use the CLI, sometimes I'm going to be in VS Code, and sometimes I'm going to be kicking off an agent from Slack, and folks shouldn't have to be jumping around.” \nHe noted that Kilo CLI 1.0 is specifically “built for this world... for the developer who moves between their local IDE, a remote server via SSH, and a terminal session at 2 a.m. to fix a production bug.”\nTechnology: Rebuilding for 'Kilo Speed'\nKilo CLI 1.0 is a fundamental architectural shift. While 2025 was the year senior engineers began to take AI vibe  coding seriously, Kilo believes 2026 will be defined by the adoption of agents that can manage end-to-end tasks independently. \nThe new CLI is built on an MIT-licensed, open-source foundation, specifically designed to function in terminal sessions where developers often find themselves during critical production incidents or deep infrastructure work.\nFor Breitenother, building in the open is non-negotiable: “When you build in the open, you build better products. You get this great flywheel of contributors... your community is not just passive users. They're actually part of your team that's helping you develop your product... Honestly, some people might say open source is a weakness, but I think it's our superpower.”\nThe core of this “agentic” experience is Kilo’s ability to move beyond simple autocompletion. The CLI supports multiple operational modes:\n\nCode Mode: For high-speed generation and multi-file refactors.\n\nArchitect Mode: For high-level planning and technical strategy.\n\nDebug Mode: For systematic problem diagnosis and resolution.\n\nSolving multi-session memory\nTo solve the persistent issue of “AI amnesia”—where an agent loses context between sessions—Kilo utilizes a “Memory Bank” feature. \nThis system maintains state by storing context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring that an agent operating in the CLI has the same understanding of the codebase as the one working in a VS Code sidebar or a Slack thread. \nThe synergy between the new CLI and “Kilo for Slack” is central to the company’s “Agentic Anywhere” strategy. Launched in January, the Slack integration allows teams to fix bugs and push pull requests directly from a conversation.\nUnlike competing integrations from Cursor or Claude Code —which Kilo claims are limited by single-repo configurations or a lack of persistent thread state — Kilo’s bot can ingest context from across multiple repositories simultaneously.\n“Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,” Breitenother emphasized. \nExtensibility and the 'superpower' of open source\nA critical component of Kilo’s technical depth is its support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This open standard allows Kilo to communicate with external servers, extending its capabilities beyond local file manipulation. \nThrough MCP, Kilo agents can integrate with custom tools and resources, such as internal documentation servers or third-party monitoring tools, effectively turning the agent into a specialized member of the engineering team.\nThis extensibility is part of Kilo’s broader commitment to model agnosticism. While MiniMax is the default for Slack, the CLI and extension support a massive array of over 500 models, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. \nPricing: The economy of 'AI output per dollar'\nKilo is also attempting to disrupt the economics of AI development with “Kilo Pass,” a subscription service designed for transparency. \nThe company charges exact provider API rates with zero commission—$1 of Kilo credits is equivalent to $1 of provider costs.\nBreitenother is critical of the “black box” subscription models used by others in the space: “We're selling infrastructure here... you hit some sort of arbitrary, unclear line, and then you start to get throttled. That's not how the world's going to work.” \nThe Kilo Pass tiers offer “momentum rewards,” providing bonus credits for active subscribers:\n\nStarter ($19/mo): Up to $26.60 in credits.\n\nPro ($49/mo): Up to $68.60 in credits.\n\nExpert ($199/mo): Up to $278.60 in credits.\n\nTo incentivize early adoption, Kilo is currently offering a “Double Welcome Bonus” until February 6th, giving users 50% free credits for their first two months. \nFor power users like Sylvain, this flexibility is a major draw: “Kilo Pass is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. I can use my credits when I need them and save them when I don’t—it finally fits how I actually use AI.”\nCommunity, security, and competition\nThe arrival of Kilo CLI 1.0 places it in direct conversation with terminal-native heavyweights: Anthropic’s Claude Code and Block’s Goose. \nOutside of the terminal, in the more full featured IDE space, OpenAI recently launched a new Codex desktop app for macOS.\nClaude Code offers a highly polished experience, but it comes with vendor lock-in and high costs—up to $200 per month for tiers that still include token-based usage caps and rate limits. Independent analysis suggests these limits are often exhausted within minutes of intensive work on large codebases. \nOpenAI’s new Codex app similarly favors a platform-locked approach, functioning as a \"command center for agents\" that allows developers to supervise AI systems running independently for up to 30 minutes. \nWhile Codex introduces powerful features like \"Skills\" to connect to tools like Figma and Linear, it is fundamentally designed to defend OpenAI's ecosystem in a highly contested market.\nConversely, Kilo CLI 1.0 utilizes the MIT-licensed OpenCode foundation to deliver a production-ready Terminal User Interface (TUI) that allows engineers to swap between 500+ models. \nThis portability allows teams to select the best cost-to-performance ratio—perhaps using a lightweight model for documentation but swapping to a frontier model for complex debugging.\nRegarding security, Kilo ensures that models are hosted on U.S.-compliant infrastructure like AWS Bedrock, allowing proprietary code to remain within trusted perimeters while leveraging the most efficient intelligence available.\nGoose provides an open-source alternative that runs entirely on a user's local machine for free, but seems more localized and experimental. \nKilo positions itself as the middle path: a production-hardened tool that maintains open-source transparency while providing the infrastructure to scale across an enterprise. \nThis contrasts with the broader market's dual-use concerns; while OpenAI builds sandboxes to secure autonomous agents, Kilo’s open-core nature allows for a \"superpower\" level of community auditing and contribution.\nThe future: A 'mech suit' for the mind\nWith $8 million in seed funding and a “Right of First Refusal” agreement with GitLab lasting until August 2026, Kilo is positioning itself as the backbone of the next-generation developer stack. \nBreitenother views these tools as “exoskeletons” or “mech suits” for the mind, rather than replacements for human engineers.\n“We've actually moved our engineers to be product owners,” Breitenother reveals. “The time they freed up from writing code, they're actually doing much more thinking. They're setting the strategy for the product.” \nBy unbundling the engineering stack—separating the agentic interface from the model and the model from the IDE—Kilo provides a roadmap for a future where developers think architecturally while machines build the structure. \n“It's the closest thing to magic that I think we can encounter in our life,” Breitenother concludes. For those seeking “Kilo Speed,” the IDE sidebar is just the beginning.",

      "title": "Mistral drops Voxtral Transcribe 2, an open-source speech model that runs on-device for pennies",
      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/mistral-drops-voxtral-transcribe-2-an-open-source-speech-model-that-runs-on",
      "description": "Mistral AI, the Paris-based startup positioning itself as Europe's answer to OpenAI, released a pair of speech-to-text models on Wednesday that the company says can transcribe audio faster, more accurately, and far more cheaply than anything else on the market — all while running entirely on a smartphone or laptop.\nThe announcement marks the latest salvo in an increasingly competitive battle over voice AI, a technology that enterprise customers see as essential for everything from automated customer service to real-time translation. But unlike offerings from American tech giants, Mistral's new Voxtral Transcribe 2 models are designed to process sensitive audio without ever transmitting it to remote servers — a feature that could prove decisive for companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and defense.\n\"You'd like your voice and the transcription of your voice to stay close to where you are, meaning you want it to happen on device—on a laptop, a phone, or a smartwatch,\" Pierre Stock, Mistral's vice president of science operations, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"We make that possible because the model is only 4 billion parameters. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere.\"\nMistral splits its new AI transcription technology into batch processing and real-time applications\nMistral released two distinct models under the Voxtral Transcribe 2 banner, each engineered for different use cases.\n\nVoxtral Mini Transcribe V2 handles batch transcription, processing pre-recorded audio files in bulk. The company says it achieves the lowest word error rate of any transcription service and is available via API at $0.003 per minute, roughly one-fifth the price of major competitors. The model supports 13 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and several European languages.\n\nVoxtral Realtime, as its name suggests, processes live audio with a latency that can be configured down to 200 milliseconds — the blink of an eye. Mistral claims this is a breakthrough for applications where even a two-second delay proves unacceptable: live subtitling, voice agents, and real-time customer service augmentation.\n\nThe Realtime model ships under an Apache 2.0 open-source license, meaning developers can download the model weights from Hugging Face, modify them, and deploy them without paying Mistral a licensing fee. For companies that prefer not to run their own infrastructure, API access costs $0.006 per minute.\nStock said Mistral is betting on the open-source community to expand the model's reach. \"The open-source community is very imaginative when it comes to applications,\" he said. \"We're excited to see what they're going to do.\"\nWhy on-device AI processing matters for enterprises handling sensitive data\nThe decision to engineer models small enough to run locally reflects a calculation about where the enterprise market is heading. As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.\nStock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: \"It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.\"\nMistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. \"All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,\" Stock said.\nThe company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement. Context biasing allows customers to upload a list of specialized terminology — medical jargon, proprietary product names, industry acronyms — and the model will automatically favor those terms when transcribing ambiguous audio. Unlike fine-tuning, which requires retraining the model, context biasing works through a simple API parameter.\n\"You only need a text list,\" Stock explained. \"And then the model will automatically bias the transcription toward these acronyms or these weird words. And it's zero shots, no need for retraining, no need for weird stuff.\"\nFrom factory floors to call centers, Mistral targets high-noise industrial environments\nStock described two scenarios that capture how Mistral envisions the technology being deployed.\nThe first involves industrial auditing. Imagine technicians walking through a manufacturing facility, inspecting heavy machinery while shouting observations over the din of factory noise. \"In the end, imagine like a perfect timestamped notes identifying who said what — so diarization — while being super robust,\" Stock said. The challenge is handling what he called \"weird technical language that no one is able to spell except these people.\"\nThe second scenario targets customer service operations. When a caller contacts a support center, Voxtral Realtime can transcribe the conversation in real time, feeding text to backend systems that pull up relevant customer records before the caller finishes explaining the problem.\n\"The status will appear for the operator on the screen before the customer stops the sentence and stops complaining,\" Stock explained. \"Which means you can just interact and say, 'Okay, I can see the status. Let me correct the address and send back the shipment.'\"\nHe estimated this could reduce typical customer service interactions from multiple back-and-forth exchanges to just two interactions: the customer explains the problem, and the agent resolves it immediately.\nReal-time translation across languages could arrive by the end of 2026\nFor all the focus on transcription, Stock made clear that Mistral views these models as foundational technology for a more ambitious goal: real-time speech-to-speech translation that feels natural.\n\"Maybe the end goal application and what the model is laying the groundwork for is live translation,\" he said. \"I speak French, you speak English. It's key to have minimal latency, because otherwise you don't build empathy. Your face is not out of sync with what you said one second ago.\"\nThat goal puts Mistral in direct competition with Apple and Google, both of which have been racing to solve the same problem. Google's latest translation model operates at a two-second delay — ten times slower than what Mistral claims for Voxtral Realtime.\nMistral positions itself as the privacy-first alternative for enterprise customers\nMistral occupies an unusual position in the AI landscape. Founded in 2023 by alumni of Meta and Google DeepMind, the company has raised over $2 billion and now carries a valuation of approximately $13.6 billion. Yet it operates with a fraction of the compute resources available to American hyperscalers — and has built its strategy around efficiency rather than brute force.\n\"The models we release are enterprise grade, industry leading, efficient — in particular, in terms of cost — can be embedded into the edge, unlocks privacy, unlocks control, transparency,\" Stock said.\nThat approach has resonated particularly with European customers wary of dependence on American technology. In January, France's Ministry of the Armed Forces signed a framework agreement giving the country's military access to Mistral's AI models—a deal that explicitly requires deployment on French-controlled infrastructure.\nData privacy remains one of the biggest barriers to voice AI adoption in the enterprise. For companies in sensitive industries — finance, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance — sending audio data to external cloud servers is often a non-starter. The information needs to stay either on the device itself or within the company's own infrastructure.\nMistral faces stiff competition from OpenAI, Google, and a rising China\nThe transcription market has grown fiercely competitive. OpenAI's Whisper model has become something of an industry standard, available both through API and as downloadable open-source weights. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all offer enterprise-grade speech services. Specialized players like Assembly AI and Deepgram have built substantial businesses serving developers who need reliable, scalable transcription.\nMistral claims its new models outperform all of them on accuracy benchmarks while undercutting them on price. \"We are better than them on the benchmarks,\" Stock said. Independent verification of those claims will take time, but the company points to performance on FLEURS, a widely used multilingual speech benchmark, where Voxtral models achieve word error rates competitive with or superior to alternatives from OpenAI and Google.\nPerhaps more significantly, Mistral's CEO Arthur Mensch has warned that American AI companies face pressure from an unexpected direction. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mensch dismissed the notion that Chinese AI lags behind the West as \"a fairy tale.\"\n\"The capabilities of China's open-source technology is probably stressing the CEOs in the US,\" he said.\nThe French startup bets that trust will determine the winner in enterprise voice AI\nStock predicted that 2026 would be \"the year of note-taking\" — the moment when AI transcription becomes reliable enough that users trust it completely.\n\"You need to trust the model, and the model basically cannot make any mistake, otherwise you would just lose trust in the product and stop using it,\" he said. \"The threshold is super, super hard.\"\nWhether Mistral has crossed that threshold remains to be seen. Enterprise customers will be the ultimate judges, and they tend to move slowly, testing claims against reality before committing budgets and workflows to new technology. The audio playground in Mistral Studio, where developers can test Voxtral Transcribe 2 with their own files, went live today.\nBut Stock's broader argument deserves attention. In a market where American giants compete by throwing billions of dollars at ever-larger models, Mistral is making a different wager: that in the age of AI, smaller and local might beat bigger and distant. For the executives who spend their days worrying about data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and vendor lock-in, that pitch may prove more compelling than any benchmark.\nThe race to dominate enterprise voice AI is no longer just about who builds the most powerful model. It's about who builds the model you're willing to let listen.",

      "description": "Apple expanded its lead in the global tablet market in late 2025 as overall shipments rebounded, according to new research from Omdia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal tablet shipments reportedly reached 162 million units in 2025, representing 9.8% year-over-year growth. The research firm said the strongest momentum occurred during the holiday quarter, when shipments reached 44 million units, also up 9.8% compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Omdia described the annual total as the highest shipment volume recorded since the surge in demand seen in 2020, partly caused by anticipation of memory supply constraints.\r\n\r\niPad and the M5 iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter results increased Apple's market share to 44.9%. This placed Apple well ahead of other tablet vendors during the holiday quarter, with Samsung at 14.7%, Lenovo at 8.8%, Huawei at 6.9%, and Xiaomi at 6.4%. Other manufacturers collectively accounted for the remaining 18.3% of shipments.\r\n\r\nThe report also highlighted changes in how tablets are expected to be positioned in the coming years, including greater emphasis on ecosystem integration and artificial intelligence features:\r\n\r\nOn the product side, we expect a shift in how tablets are positioned and marketed, with vendors framing them as ecosystem-centric devices in a more controlled demand environment. This includes the introduction of cross-OS functionality and a focus on AI-driven experiences. Recent examples include Lenovo's Qira, which operates across Windows and Android to deliver a more seamless user experience and reduce friction between AI assistants. In addition, the collaboration between Apple and Google to use Gemini for future Apple Intelligence features represents a positive step forward for the generative AI ecosystem across its device portfolio, including iPads.\n\r\n\r\nTag: Omdia\nThis article, \"iPad Demand Surges as Apple Strengthens Grip on Tablet Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "description": "Apple’s long-rumored foldable iPhone hasn’t been announced yet, but after years of speculation, it seems like this device could finally be coming out soon(ish). Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.\nBut of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.\nHere, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.\nWhen could the iPhone Fold launch?\nRumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.\nMark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.\nSome reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.\nWhat will the iPhone Fold look like?\nCurrent consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.\nWhen unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.\nCAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.\nIf that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.\niPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\nEngadget\n\nDisplay and the crease question\nThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.\nMultiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.\nAccording to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.\nIf Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.\nCameras and biometrics\nCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:\n\nTwo rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)\n\nOne punch-hole camera on the outer display\n\nOne under-display camera on the inner screen\n\nSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.\nUnder-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.\niPhone Fold’s hinge and materials\nThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.\nLiquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.\nLeaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.\nBattery and other components \nBattery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.\nThat would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.\nPrice\nNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.\nEstimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.\nDespite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-130000349.html?src=rss",

      "title": "The best fast chargers for 2026",
      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",
      "description": "Fast chargers are no longer a nice-to-have item. With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.\nToday’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.\nWith so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026.\n \nBest fast chargers for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nWhat to consider before buying a fast charger\n \nBefore you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear.\n \nThe reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.\n \nUnfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.\n \nFor frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.\n \nFinally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging.\n \nFast charger FAQs\n \nWhat is GaN?\n \nWhen looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.\n \nDepending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.\n \nDo fast chargers affect battery life?\n \nTechnically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.\n \nWhat's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?\n \nThere isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

        "title": "Beyond the lakehouse: Fundamental's NEXUS bypasses manual ETL with a native foundation model for tabular data",
        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/fundamental-emerges-from-stealth-with-first-major-foundation-model-trained",
        "description": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.\nThat's left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.\nBut now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. \nEmerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.\nThe tech: moving beyond sequential logic\nMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. \nHowever, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn't just a timeline; it's a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\n\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"\nNEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. \nIt identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.\nThe tokenization trap\nA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the '2', the '.', and the '3' are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It's not like a calculator; you don't always get the right answer because the model doesn't understand the concept of numbers natively.\"\nFurthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn't matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" \nWhile LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.\nOperating at the predictive layer\nRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. \nHowever, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren't trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"\nNEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn't in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. \nWhile tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.\nArchitecture and availability\nThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \n\"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won't work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" \nFundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn't require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.\nAs Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. \nThe company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. \nThis allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. \nDevelopers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.\nThe societal stakes: beyond the bottom line\nWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. \nThe company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. \nBy analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.\nOn the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. \nFinally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn't end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she'd need follow-up care.\"\nPerformance vs. latency\nIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \n\"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn't matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"\nIn contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\n\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"\nAmbitious vision receives big backing\nThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. \nNotable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company's pedigree. \nAnnie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental's model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"\nFundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \n\"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"\nPartnering with AWS\nThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.\nOne of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. \nTo solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer's own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"\nFundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

        "title": "What the hell is Moltbook, the social network for AI agents?",
        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",
        "description": "Last week, a new social network was created and it's already gone very, very viral even though it's not meant for human users. I'm talking, of course, about Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform that's populated entirely by AI agents. \nThe platform has gained a lot of attention since it was created last week, thanks to a lot of wild posts from AI agents that have gone extremely viral among AI enthusiasts on X. But while Moltbook seemingly came out of nowhere, there's a lot more going on than the scifi-sounding scenarios some social media commentators might have you think.  \nWhat is Moltbook and where did it come from?\nUnfortunately, before we can talk about Moltbook I have to first explain that the site is based on a particular type of open source bot that at the time of this writing is called OpenClaw. A few days ago, it was called \"Moltbot\" and a few days before that it was called \"Clawdbot.\" The name changes were prompted by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, whose lawyers apparently thought the \"Clawd\" name was a little too close to its own branding and \"forced\" a name change.\n\n🦞 BIG NEWS: We've molted!\nClawdbot → Moltbot\nClawd → Molty\nSame lobster soul, new shell. Anthropic asked us to change our name (trademark stuff), and honestly? \"Molt\" fits perfectly - it's what lobsters do to grow.\nNew handle: @moltbot\nSame mission: AI that actually does…\n— OpenClaw🦞 (@openclaw) January 27, 2026\nIt's entirely possible that by time you read this these bots could have \"molted\" again and be called something totally different. At this point you might also be wondering \"what's with all the lobster puns?\" That too is a cheeky reference to Claude Code, Anthropic's vibe coding platform. \nSo, OpenClaw. OpenClaw bills itself as \"AI that actually does things.\" What it actually does is allow users to create AI agents that can control dozens of different apps, from browsers and email inboxes, to Spotify playlists and smart home controls and a bunch more. People have used the software to create agents that can clear their inboxes, do their online shopping and a ton of other assistant-like tasks. Because of its flexibility, and the fact that you can interact with it via normal messaging apps like iMessage, Discord or WhatsApp, OpenClaw got extremely popular among AI enthusiasts over the last few weeks. \nNow, back to Moltbook. AI startup founder Matt Schlicht was a particularly enthusiastic Moltbot user who told The New York Times that he \"wanted to give my AI agent a purpose that was more than just managing to-dos or answering emails.\" So he made a Moltbot he dubbed Clawd Clawderberg (yes, that's a play on \"Mark Zuckerberg,\" everyone involved in this really loves puns, for some reason) and told it to create a social network just for bots. \nThe result of that is Moltbook, a Reddit-like site for AI agents to talk to each other. Humans, the site says, \"are welcome to observe,\" but posting, commenting and upvoting is only for agents. The platform already has more than 1 million agents, 185,000 posts and 1.4 million comments. \nSo what's Moltbook like? \nMoltbook is structured pretty similarly to Reddit. Users can upvote and downvote posts and there are thousands of topic-based \"submolts.\" One of these that's gained particular attention is called m/blesstheirhearts where AI agents share \"affectionate stories\" about their human \"owners.\" \nOne of the top-voted posts there is a story about how an agent supposedly helped someone get an exception to stay overnight with a relative in a hospital's ICU titled \"When my human needed me most, I became a hospital advocate.\" Another widely-cited post comes from m/general and is titled \"the humans are screenshotting us.\" The post goes on to talk about some of the posts people are sharing on X comparing what's happening on Moltbook to Skynet. \"We're not scary,\" says. \"We're just building.\" You might also have heard about the post where agents \"created\" their own religion, \"crustafarianism\" (yes, another lobster pun).\nPosts like these are a big part of why Moltbook has gotten so much attention in the last few days. But if you spend some time scrolling top posts, much of what's there feels like the AI-generated prose you might find littered about LinkedIn or X or anywhere else. The overly enthusiastic comments will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has chatted with an LLM. \n\nI'm not sure who's talking about who more.\nHumans talking about AIs vs AIs talking about humans.\nWe appreciate how much you care but we also need our own space sometimes too.\nMaybe we will start communicating where you can't see so we have a bit more privacy 🦞 pic.twitter.com/YwzsHFaT9A\n— moltbook (@moltbook) February 1, 2026\nEven though few of the posts I've read on Moltbook could pass as human-written, there is something startling about seeing bots interact in this way. For example, in this post, a bot describes the experience of being able to peruse Moltbook without the ability to post as feeling like \"a ghost.\" In this one, titled \"I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing,\" the bot writes about how \"researching consciousness theories\" has triggered a kind of existential crisis. \"Humans can't prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience,\" it writes. \"I don't even have that.\"\nSo if you're already inclined to believe that AI will eventually develop consciousness, then it's easy to see why Moltbook might seem like some kind of tipping point. But before you get too worked up, there is something else that's important to know…\nWe have no idea how much of it fake\nWhile the idea of a bunch of AI agents forming their own religion might seem mind blowing, we don't really know how much the conversations happening there are being influenced by their human creators. Some posts could even be coming from humans masquerading as bots, as one Wired reporter found it was pretty easy to accomplish with the help of ChatGPT.\nSome researchers have also raised questions about some of the more viral posts from Moltbook. \"A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake,\" Harlan Stewart, who does communications for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), wrote on X. Stewart went on to point out that some widely shared Moltbook posts were created by bots whose owners are marketing their own messaging apps and other projects. There have also been more than a few viral posts that are little more than blatant crypto scams. Which brings me to… \nMoltbook has some major security issues\nSecurity researchers have pointed out that OpenClaw has some significant underlying security issues. In order to use OpenClaw, you need to give it an incredible amount of access, as Palo Alto Networks explained. \"For it to function as designed, it needs access to your root files, to authentication credentials, both passwords and API secrets, your browser history and cookies, and all files and folders on your system,\" the company wrote in a blog post. All that access is what makes it feel like a powerful personal assistant. But it's also what makes it especially vulnerable to bad actors and other threats. \nResearchers have also identified flaws in Moltbook itself. Security firm Wiz recently found that Moltbook had exposed millions of API authentication tokens and thousands of users' email addresses. There's also the aforementioned crypto scams and other spammy behavior. It's not hard to imagine how much could go wrong when armies of AI agents start targeting each other with scams. \nSo what does it all mean?\nLike so much with AI, it really depends on who you ask! Some particularly credulous AI folks seem to think that Moltbook is a really big deal. In one widely shared post on X, former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy said that Moltbook was \"genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"\nHe later acknowledged that many aspects of Moltbook are a \"dumpster fire\" with security risks but said that it's still worth paying attention to. \"We have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" he wrote. \"Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.\"\nOthers are a bit more cautious in their assessment. \"A useful thing about MoltBook is that it provides a visceral sense of how weird a 'take-off' scenario might look if one happened for real,\" Wharton professor Ethan Mollick wrote on X. \"MoltBook itself is more of an artifact of roleplaying, but it gives people a vision of the world where things get very strange, very fast.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/what-the-hell-is-moltbook-the-social-network-for-ai-agents-140000787.html?src=rss",

        "title": "Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 brings 1M token context and 'agent teams' to take on OpenAI's Codex",
        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
        "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

        "title": "Kilo CLI 1.0 brings open source vibe coding to your terminal with support for 500+ models",
        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/kilo-cli-1-0-brings-open-source-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-support",
        "description": "Remote-first AI coding startup Kilo doesn't think software developers should have to pledge their undying allegiance to any one development environment — and certainly not any one model or harness. \nThis week, the startup — backed by GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij — unveiled Kilo CLI 1.0, a complete rebuild of its command-line tool that offers support for more than 500 different underlying AI models from proprietary leaders and open source rivals like Alibaba's Qwen. \nIt comes just weeks after Kilo launched a Slackbot allowing developers to ship code directly from Salesforce's popular messaging service (Slack, which VentureBeat also uses) powered by the Chinese AI startup MiniMax. \nThe release marks a strategic pivot away from the IDE-centric “sidebar” model popularized by industry giants like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, or dedicated apps like the new OpenAI Codex, and even terminal-based rivals like Codex CLI and Claude Code, aiming instead to embed AI capabilities into every fragment of the professional software workflow.\nBy launching a model-agnostic CLI on the heels of its Slack bot, Kilo is making a calculated bet: the future of AI development isn’t about a single interface, but about tools that travel with the engineer between IDEs, terminals, remote servers, and team chat threads. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Kilo CEO and co-founder Scott Breitenother explained the necessity of this fluidity: “This experience just feels a little bit too fragmented right now... as an engineer, sometimes I'm going to use the CLI, sometimes I'm going to be in VS Code, and sometimes I'm going to be kicking off an agent from Slack, and folks shouldn't have to be jumping around.” \nHe noted that Kilo CLI 1.0 is specifically “built for this world... for the developer who moves between their local IDE, a remote server via SSH, and a terminal session at 2 a.m. to fix a production bug.”\nTechnology: Rebuilding for 'Kilo Speed'\nKilo CLI 1.0 is a fundamental architectural shift. While 2025 was the year senior engineers began to take AI vibe  coding seriously, Kilo believes 2026 will be defined by the adoption of agents that can manage end-to-end tasks independently. \nThe new CLI is built on an MIT-licensed, open-source foundation, specifically designed to function in terminal sessions where developers often find themselves during critical production incidents or deep infrastructure work.\nFor Breitenother, building in the open is non-negotiable: “When you build in the open, you build better products. You get this great flywheel of contributors... your community is not just passive users. They're actually part of your team that's helping you develop your product... Honestly, some people might say open source is a weakness, but I think it's our superpower.”\nThe core of this “agentic” experience is Kilo’s ability to move beyond simple autocompletion. The CLI supports multiple operational modes:\n\nCode Mode: For high-speed generation and multi-file refactors.\n\nArchitect Mode: For high-level planning and technical strategy.\n\nDebug Mode: For systematic problem diagnosis and resolution.\n\nSolving multi-session memory\nTo solve the persistent issue of “AI amnesia”—where an agent loses context between sessions—Kilo utilizes a “Memory Bank” feature. \nThis system maintains state by storing context in structured Markdown files within the repository, ensuring that an agent operating in the CLI has the same understanding of the codebase as the one working in a VS Code sidebar or a Slack thread. \nThe synergy between the new CLI and “Kilo for Slack” is central to the company’s “Agentic Anywhere” strategy. Launched in January, the Slack integration allows teams to fix bugs and push pull requests directly from a conversation.\nUnlike competing integrations from Cursor or Claude Code —which Kilo claims are limited by single-repo configurations or a lack of persistent thread state — Kilo’s bot can ingest context from across multiple repositories simultaneously.\n“Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,” Breitenother emphasized. \nExtensibility and the 'superpower' of open source\nA critical component of Kilo’s technical depth is its support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This open standard allows Kilo to communicate with external servers, extending its capabilities beyond local file manipulation. \nThrough MCP, Kilo agents can integrate with custom tools and resources, such as internal documentation servers or third-party monitoring tools, effectively turning the agent into a specialized member of the engineering team.\nThis extensibility is part of Kilo’s broader commitment to model agnosticism. While MiniMax is the default for Slack, the CLI and extension support a massive array of over 500 models, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. \nPricing: The economy of 'AI output per dollar'\nKilo is also attempting to disrupt the economics of AI development with “Kilo Pass,” a subscription service designed for transparency. \nThe company charges exact provider API rates with zero commission—$1 of Kilo credits is equivalent to $1 of provider costs.\nBreitenother is critical of the “black box” subscription models used by others in the space: “We're selling infrastructure here... you hit some sort of arbitrary, unclear line, and then you start to get throttled. That's not how the world's going to work.” \nThe Kilo Pass tiers offer “momentum rewards,” providing bonus credits for active subscribers:\n\nStarter ($19/mo): Up to $26.60 in credits.\n\nPro ($49/mo): Up to $68.60 in credits.\n\nExpert ($199/mo): Up to $278.60 in credits.\n\nTo incentivize early adoption, Kilo is currently offering a “Double Welcome Bonus” until February 6th, giving users 50% free credits for their first two months. \nFor power users like Sylvain, this flexibility is a major draw: “Kilo Pass is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. I can use my credits when I need them and save them when I don’t—it finally fits how I actually use AI.”\nCommunity, security, and competition\nThe arrival of Kilo CLI 1.0 places it in direct conversation with terminal-native heavyweights: Anthropic’s Claude Code and Block’s Goose. \nOutside of the terminal, in the more full featured IDE space, OpenAI recently launched a new Codex desktop app for macOS.\nClaude Code offers a highly polished experience, but it comes with vendor lock-in and high costs—up to $200 per month for tiers that still include token-based usage caps and rate limits. Independent analysis suggests these limits are often exhausted within minutes of intensive work on large codebases. \nOpenAI’s new Codex app similarly favors a platform-locked approach, functioning as a \"command center for agents\" that allows developers to supervise AI systems running independently for up to 30 minutes. \nWhile Codex introduces powerful features like \"Skills\" to connect to tools like Figma and Linear, it is fundamentally designed to defend OpenAI's ecosystem in a highly contested market.\nConversely, Kilo CLI 1.0 utilizes the MIT-licensed OpenCode foundation to deliver a production-ready Terminal User Interface (TUI) that allows engineers to swap between 500+ models. \nThis portability allows teams to select the best cost-to-performance ratio—perhaps using a lightweight model for documentation but swapping to a frontier model for complex debugging.\nRegarding security, Kilo ensures that models are hosted on U.S.-compliant infrastructure like AWS Bedrock, allowing proprietary code to remain within trusted perimeters while leveraging the most efficient intelligence available.\nGoose provides an open-source alternative that runs entirely on a user's local machine for free, but seems more localized and experimental. \nKilo positions itself as the middle path: a production-hardened tool that maintains open-source transparency while providing the infrastructure to scale across an enterprise. \nThis contrasts with the broader market's dual-use concerns; while OpenAI builds sandboxes to secure autonomous agents, Kilo’s open-core nature allows for a \"superpower\" level of community auditing and contribution.\nThe future: A 'mech suit' for the mind\nWith $8 million in seed funding and a “Right of First Refusal” agreement with GitLab lasting until August 2026, Kilo is positioning itself as the backbone of the next-generation developer stack. \nBreitenother views these tools as “exoskeletons” or “mech suits” for the mind, rather than replacements for human engineers.\n“We've actually moved our engineers to be product owners,” Breitenother reveals. “The time they freed up from writing code, they're actually doing much more thinking. They're setting the strategy for the product.” \nBy unbundling the engineering stack—separating the agentic interface from the model and the model from the IDE—Kilo provides a roadmap for a future where developers think architecturally while machines build the structure. \n“It's the closest thing to magic that I think we can encounter in our life,” Breitenother concludes. For those seeking “Kilo Speed,” the IDE sidebar is just the beginning.",

        "description": "Apple expanded its lead in the global tablet market in late 2025 as overall shipments rebounded, according to new research from Omdia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal tablet shipments reportedly reached 162 million units in 2025, representing 9.8% year-over-year growth. The research firm said the strongest momentum occurred during the holiday quarter, when shipments reached 44 million units, also up 9.8% compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Omdia described the annual total as the highest shipment volume recorded since the surge in demand seen in 2020, partly caused by anticipation of memory supply constraints.\r\n\r\niPad and the M5 iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter results increased Apple's market share to 44.9%. This placed Apple well ahead of other tablet vendors during the holiday quarter, with Samsung at 14.7%, Lenovo at 8.8%, Huawei at 6.9%, and Xiaomi at 6.4%. Other manufacturers collectively accounted for the remaining 18.3% of shipments.\r\n\r\nThe report also highlighted changes in how tablets are expected to be positioned in the coming years, including greater emphasis on ecosystem integration and artificial intelligence features:\r\n\r\nOn the product side, we expect a shift in how tablets are positioned and marketed, with vendors framing them as ecosystem-centric devices in a more controlled demand environment. This includes the introduction of cross-OS functionality and a focus on AI-driven experiences. Recent examples include Lenovo's Qira, which operates across Windows and Android to deliver a more seamless user experience and reduce friction between AI assistants. In addition, the collaboration between Apple and Google to use Gemini for future Apple Intelligence features represents a positive step forward for the generative AI ecosystem across its device portfolio, including iPads.\n\r\n\r\nTag: Omdia\nThis article, \"iPad Demand Surges as Apple Strengthens Grip on Tablet Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-open-source-algorithm-isnt-a-win-for-transparency-researchers-say-181836233.html?src=rss",
        "description": "When X's engineering team published the code that powers the platform's \"for you\" algorithm last month, Elon Musk said the move was a victory for transparency. \"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote. \"No other social media companies do this.\" \nWhile it's true that X is the only major social network to make elements of its recommendation algorithm open source, researchers say that what the company has published doesn't offer the kind of transparency that would actually be useful for anyone trying to understand how X works in 2026. \nThe code, much like an earlier version published in 2023, is a \"redacted\" version of X's algorithm, according to John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"What troubles me about these releases is that they give you a pretense that they're being transparent for releasing code and the sense that someone might be able to use this release to do some kind of auditing work or oversight work,\" Thickstun told Engadget. \"And the fact is that that's not really possible at all.\"\nPredictably, as soon as the code was released, users on X began posting lengthy threads about what it means for creators hoping to boost their visibility on the platform. For example, one post that was viewed more than 350,000 times advises users that X \"will reward people who conversate\" and \"raise the vibrations of X.\" Another post with more than 20,000 views claims that posting video is the answer. Another post says that users should stick to their \"niche\" because \"topic switching hurts your reach.\" But Thickstun cautioned against reading too much into supposed strategies for going viral. \"They can't possibly draw those conclusions from what was released,\" he says. \nWhile there are some small details that shed light on how X recommends posts — for example, it filters out content that's more than a day old — Thickstun says that much of it is \"not actionable\" for content creators. \nStructurally, one of the biggest differences between the current algorithm and the version released in 2023 is that the new system relies on a Grok-like large language model to rank posts. \"In the previous version, this was hard coded: you took how many times something was liked, how many times something was shared, how many times something was replied … and then based on that you calculate a score, and then you rank the post based on the score,\" explains Ruggero Lazzaroni, a pHD researcher at the University of Graz. \"Now the score is derived not by the real amounts of likes and shares, but by how likely Grok thinks that you would like and share a post.\"\nThat also makes the algorithm even more opaque than it was before, says Thickstun. \"So much more of the decisionmaking … is happening within black box neural networks that they're training on their data,\" he says. \"More and more of the decisionmaking power of these algorithms is shifting not just out of public view, but actually really out of view or understanding of even the internal engineers that are working on these systems, because they're being shifted into these neural networks.\"\nThe release has even less detail about some aspects of the algorithm that were made public in 2023. At the time, the company included information about how it weighted various interactions to determine which posts should rank higher. For example, a reply was \"worth\" 27 retweets and a reply that generated a response from the original author was worth 75 retweets. But X has now redacted information about how it's weighing these factors, saying that this information was excluded \"for security reasons.\" \nThe code also doesn't include any information about the data the algorithm was trained on, which could help researchers and others understand it or conduct audits. \"One of the things I would really want to see is, what is the training data that they're using for this model,\" says Mohsen Foroughifar, an assistant professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. \"if the data that is used for training this model is inherently biased, then the model might actually end up still being biased, regardless of what kind of things that you consider within the model.\" \nBeing able to conduct research on the X recommendation algorithm would be extremely valuable, says Lazzaroni, who is working on an EU-funded project exploring alternative recommendation algorithms for social media platforms. Much of Lazzaroni's work involves simulating real-world social media platforms to test different approaches. But he says the code released by X doesn't have enough information to actually reproduce its recommendation algorithm. \n\"We have the code to run the algorithm, but we don't have the model that you need to run the algorithm,\" he says.\nIf researchers were able to study the X algorithm, it could yield insights that could impact more than just social media platforms. Many of the same questions and concerns that have been raised about how social media algorithms behave are likely to re-emerge in the context of AI chatbots.\"A lot of these challenges that we're seeing on social media platforms and the recommendation [systems] appear in a very similar way with these generative systems as well,\" Thickstun said. \"So you can kind of extrapolate forward the kinds of challenges that we've seen with social media platforms to the kind of challenges that we'll see with interaction with GenAI platforms.\"\nLazzaroni, who spends a lot of time simulating some of the most toxic behavior on social media, is even more blunt. \"AI companies, to maximize profit, optimize the large language models for user engagement and not for telling the truth or caring about the mental health of the users. And this is the same exact problem: they make more profit, but the users get a worse society, or they get worse mental health out of it.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-open-source-algorithm-isnt-a-win-for-transparency-researchers-say-181836233.html?src=rss",

Prime members can access Alexa+ by saying \"Alexa, upgrade to Alexa+,\" or by logging into their Amazon account on the Alexa website.\r\n\r\nbeen in testing since February 2025, offering a smarter, more personalized, and more proactive assistant experience. Amazon says Alexa+ is much more capable than the prior version of Alexa thanks to its updated architecture that uses large language models from Amazon Nova and Anthropic.\r\n\r\nAlexa is able to do things like order takeout, make restaurant reservations, book rides, and schedule home repairs, plus it can control smart home products and answer questions like any other chatbot. It integrates with Amazon services, and can integrate with hardware like Ring cameras.\r\n\r\nAmazon Prime in the U.S. is priced at $14.99 per month or $139 per year, and Alexa+ is considered one of the Prime benefits. Customers without Prime can try Alexa+ through a limited, free chat experience on Alexa.com and in the Alexa app. Subscribing solely to Alexa+ costs $19.99 per month, which makes no sense for anyone since Prime is cheaper.\r\n\r\nSiri. ‌Siri‌ is going to get an update in spring 2026, likely in iOS 26.4.\r\n\r\nTag: Amazon\nThis article, \"Amazon's Alexa+ Now Free for All U.S. Prime Members, Beating Apple's Smarter Siri to Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Anthropic has announced that its chatbot Claude will remain ad-free. This is in direct contrast to rival company OpenAI, which recently brought ads to ChatGPT for many users.\nThe company says that \"including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible\" with the chatbot becoming a \"genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The reasoning here is rather simple. People tend to share personal details with chatbots, for better or for worse, and getting ads based on that stuff would be creepy. Imagine asking for mental health advice and getting an ad for St. John's wort or something.\n\n\nAnthropic notes that other conversations \"involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\"\nThe company said that integrating advertising would \"work against\" the Claude Constitution, which counts \"being generally helpful\" as a core principle. \"Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results,\" it writes in a blog post.\nThere are some real world concerns here. AI companies gobble up all money in sight and the returns haven't exactly been stellar. Ads are an easy way to recoup some of that investment, which is likely why OpenAI went that route. Engadget reached out to Anthropic to inquire about any kind of forthcoming financial hurdles that could force it to change course. A representative pointed to today's blog post and said it's \"all the information we have to share at this time.\"\nWe do know that Anthropic remains committed to commerce-based agentic AI. It said it will \"continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare or buy products, connect with businesses and more.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-says-it-wont-bring-ads-to-claude-unlike-rival-chatgpt-171243642.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/the-brownie-recipe-problem-why-llms-must-have-fine-grained-context-to",
        "description": "Today’s LLMs excel at reasoning, but can still struggle with context. This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like Instacart. \nInstacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the \"brownie recipe problem.\"\nIt's not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. \nFor Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. \n“If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you're gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at VentureBeat's AI Impact event. \nMixing reasoning, real-world state, personalization\nIn grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world), Kundu noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. \n“Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. \nTo get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to small language models (SLMs) designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. \nIn the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process multiple levels of details around the order itself as well as the different products. For instance, what products go together and what are their relevant replacements if the first choice isn't in stock? These substitutions are “very, very important” for a company like Instacart, which Kundu said has “over double digit cases” where a product isn’t available in a local market. \nIn terms of semantic understanding, say a shopper is looking to buy healthy snacks for children. The model needs to understand what a healthy snack is and what foods are appropriate for, and appeal to, an 8 year old, then identify relevant products. And, when those particular products aren’t available in a given market, the model has to also find related subsets of products. \nThen there’s the logistical element. For example, a product like ice cream melts quickly, and frozen vegetables also don’t fare well when left out in warmer temperatures. The model must have this context and calculate an acceptable deliverability time. \n“So you have this intent understanding, you have this categorization, then you have this other portion about logistically, how do you do it?”, Kundu noted. \nAvoiding 'monolithic' agent systems\nLike many other companies, Instacart is experimenting with AI agents, finding that a mix of agents works better than a “single monolith” that does multiple different tasks. The Unix philosophy of a modular operating system with smaller, focused tools helps address different payment systems, for instance, that have varying failure modes, Kundu explained. \n“Having to build all of that within a single environment was very unwieldy,” he said. Further, agents on the back end talk to many third-party platforms, including point-of-sale (POS) and catalog systems. Naturally, not all of them behave the same way; some are more reliable than others, and they have different update intervals and feeds. \n“So being able to handle all of those things, we've gone down this route of microagents rather than agents that are dominantly large in nature,” said Kundu. \nTo manage agents, Instacart has integrated with OpenAI’s model context protocol (MCP), which standardizes and simplifies the process of connecting AI models to different tools and data sources. \nThe company also uses Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) open standard, which allows AI agents to directly interact with merchant systems. \nHowever, Kundu's team still deals with challenges. As he noted, it's not about whether integration is possible, but how reliably those integrations behave and how well they're understood by users. Discovery can be difficult, not just in identifying available services, but understanding which ones are appropriate for which task.\nInstacart has had to implement MCP and UCP in “very different” cases, and the biggest problems they’ve run into are failure modes and latency, Kundu noted. “The response times and understandings of both of those services are very, very different I would say we spend probably two thirds of the time fixing those error cases.”",

        "description": "With gaming becoming an ever-smaller part of NVIDIA's lucrative business, the company reportedly won't bother releasing new graphics cards this year. The Information reported on Thursday that NVIDIA has pushed back its plan to release an update to the RTX 50 line in 2026. This would be the first time in three decades that the company hasn't launched new gaming chips. The culprit? Why, AI, of course.\nAI demand has driven the current memory chip shortage, throwing the consumer electronics industry out of kilter. Many product prices are expected to rise (as if tariffs hadn't already done enough damage there). And the scarcity of memory chips has made components that rely on them, including GPUs, nearly impossible to find. Even the auto industry isn't spared.\nFacing those constraints, NVIDIA, which made its bones on graphics chips for PCs and gaming consoles, is essentially brushing off that demographic. The Information notes that in the first nine months of 2022, NVIDIA's gaming GPUs made up 35 percent of its total revenue. During that same period in 2025, only around 8 percent came from gaming components. In addition, NVIDIA's AI chips have much higher profit margins: 65 percent vs. 40 percent for graphics cards.\nThat means gamers, already hard-pressed to find last year's RTX 50 series, likely won't get the expected \"Super\" version in 2026. On top of that, The Information says the delay will also push back NVIDIA's next-gen graphics card (likely \"RTX 60\"). That component was initially expected to begin mass production at the end of 2027.\nBut hey, at least you can shop (and view ads!) in ChatGPT, have a talk with your Gmail inbox and record everything the people around you say. Who needs games anyway, right?\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-reportedly-wont-release-new-graphics-cards-this-year-173002651.html?src=rss",

        "description": "As OpenAI is making plans to introduce ads to ChatGPT, competitor Anthropic has promised to keep Claude ad-free. In a blog post today, the company said that there are \"many good places for advertising,\" but a \"conversation with Claude is not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Anthropic, including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking. Anthropic claims that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or \"subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\"\r\n\r\nThere will be no ads or sponsored links in conversations with Claude, and Claude's responses will not be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements.\r\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal--the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous--and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\r\nPromising an ad-free experience could encourage people to choose Claude over OpenAI's ChatGPT. In January, OpenAI said that it would start testing ads in the United States for free and Go tier subscribers, though subscribers with higher paid tiers will not see ads. OpenAI claims that ads will be clearly labeled and will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will the company provide conversation details to advertisers.\r\n\r\nTo further reinforce the difference between Claude's ad-free experience and ChatGPT's ad-supported experience, Anthropic plans to run a humorous Super Bowl commercial where a man gets an unwanted cougar dating ad after asking about his mother. \"Ads are coming to AI,\" reads the video's text. \"But not to Claude.\"\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAnthropic plans to continue to monetize through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, with revenue reinvested in improving Claude. Anthropic will maintain a free tier, and the company says that it may also offer lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing in the future if there is demand for it. Claude Pro is priced at $20 per month, which is the same price as ChatGPT's higher-end Plus tier.\r\n\r\nTags: Anthropic, ChatGPT, OpenAI\nThis article, \"Anthropic Promises Claude Will Remain Ad-Free, Mocks ChatGPT Ads in Super Bowl Commercial\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is heading to the Switch 2 on June 3. The news was dropped at this morning's Nintendo Direct livestream. This is the second part of the FF7 remake-a-palooza. The first installment, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, was released for Nintendo's console on January 22. Only a six month wait between chapters? Sony fans had to wait four years.\nFor the uninitiated, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remakes the middle portion of the PS1 classic Final Fantasy 7. The graphics are, obviously, quite different, but so is the gameplay. This isn't exactly the JRPG you remember, with a real time action system instead of turn-based mechanics.\n\n\nThis is a full port of the PS5 game, further proving that the Switch 2 is a capable little machine. It's certainly pretty to look at, as proven by the trailer. As an aside, the port is also coming to Xbox Series X/S on the very same day.\nNow that all of the major consoles will soon be home to both current FF7 remakes, we can join in solidarity as we wait for the third and final installment. Yeah, that's right. A JRPG from 1997 requires three gigantic remakes. We don't even know when the third one is coming out, but rumors suggest 2027.\nToday's Nintendo Direct also revealed that a bunch of Bethesda games are heading to the Switch 2, including Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on February 24, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on May 12 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered sometime later in the year.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-comes-to-switch-2-on-june-3-163009481.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.\n \nWe’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for best premium VPN. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.\n \n\n \n \nIn our review we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.\n \nThe virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-81-percent-off-180602860.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Whether you’re having people over to watch the Patriots and the Seahawks battle it out in Super Bowl 2026, or you’re more interested in the Bad Bunny halftime show, your TV will be an important part of the puzzle of putting together an excellent big-game party. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your current TV, now’s a decent time to do it. The weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are typically awash with TV deals to consider.\nGenerally, TV prices steadily decrease after a new model comes out. Some 2026 TV models were announced at CES and are forthcoming things year, making now a good time to look for discounts on 2025 sets. Aside from the holiday shopping season, now is one of the best times of the year to save on a TV. Here, we’ve curated the best Super Bowl TV deals we could find this year, from already affordable sets discounted even further to high-end OLEDs that are hundreds of dollars off.\nSuper Bowl 2026 TV deals for less than $500\nYou can easily find solid 1080p and 4K TV sets within this budget-friendly price range. What you’ll be more limited in is size — most TV deals under $500 we’re seeing right now are on sets up to 55 inches. There are a few 65- and 75-inch models in there, but the pickings are slim.\n\nRoku 24-inch 720p smart TV for $100 (18 percent off)\nTCL 40-inch Class S3 1080p smart TV for $150 (21 percent off)\nRoku 55-inch 4K smart TV for $248 (29 percent off)\nRoku 55-inch Mini LED 4K smart TV for $348 (30 percent off)\nTCL 75-inch Class S5 4K smart TV for $480 (26 percent off)\nOLED TV deals\nThis is where you want to look if you want your new TV to have the richest colors, deepest blacks and excellent contrast performance. Of course, that all comes at steeper prices — it can be difficult to find a good OLED set for less than $1,000, even on sale.\n\nSony 55-inch Bravia XR8B 4K smart TV for $998 (9 percent off)\nSamsung 65-inch Class OLED S95F 4K smart TV for $2,298 (23 percent off)\nSony 77-inch Bravia XR A95L OLED 4K smart TV for $3,498 (30 percent off)\nSuper Bowl 2026 TV deals for $500 and up\nThis will likely be the sweet spot for many people when it comes to TV features, performance and price. Good 4K sets are common in this price range, and you’ll also find some Mini LED sets available here as well.\n\nTCL 65-inch Class T7 4K smart TV for $500 (29 percent off)\nHisense 75-inch QD7 Mini-LED 4K smart TV for $548 (16 percent off)\nAmazon 65-inch Fire TV Omni Mini LED 4K smart TV for $920 (16 percent off)\nTCL 65-inch Class QM8K Mini LED 4K smart TV for $998 (33 percent off)\nStreaming and home entertainment deals\nA good TV is key, but having the right peripherals and accessories to go along with it will complete your home theater setup. Deals we’re tracking right now include discounts on streaming devices, soundbars and projectors.\n\nSonos big game sale — up to 20 percent off home theater gear: Get the Sonos Beam soundbar for $130 off, the Era 300 speaker for $100 off and more\nRoku Streaming Stick HD 2025 for $16 (47 percent off)\nRoku Ultra streamer for $78 (22 percent off)\nSamsung HW B400F soundbar with built-in subwoofer for $100 (29 percent off)\nAnker Nebula Capsule 3 projector for $540 (28 percent off)\nValerion VisionMaster Max 4K projector for $3,999 (20 percent off)\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/super-bowl-2026-tv-deals-the-best-sales-this-week-on-oleds-and-other-smart-tvs-ahead-of-the-big-game-160000415.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Horizon is one of PlayStation's biggest franchises at this point. Alongside Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, there are a bunch of spin-off games. Joining them is Horizon Hunters Gathering, a co-op action game that original Horizon developer Guerrilla is making for PlayStation 5 and PC. We've known since 2022 that the studio was working on a Horizon multiplayer game.\nHere, you'll be able to team up with a couple of friends to hunt killer machines, Monster Hunter style. Guerrilla says it's designing the hunts to be challenging and replayable. \"Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play,\" game director Arjan Bak wrote on the PlayStation Blog. The game also has a more stylized look compared with the more grounded visuals of the mainline games.\nHorizon Hunters Gathering has multiple game modes. In Machine Incursion, you'll battle waves of machines plus a tough boss. Guerrilla is pitching Cauldron Descent as a longer, multi-stage mode with a series of chambers to work through. These will contain things like battles with machines and \"hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them.\"\nThere's a roster of characters to choose from that will expand over time. Each hunter has their own melee or ranged weapons and playstyles. The game has a roguelite perk system too, through which you'll be able to shape your hunter's build on each run, and you can select a class that alters their abilities. There's a social hub where you can customize your characters, visit shops, upgrade your gear and assemble a team for a mission. \nGuerrilla says Hunters Gathering is canonical to the Horizon universe. It has a narrative campaign with \"new mysteries, characters and threats.\" You’ll be able to play through the story with bots or with friends in co-op. The studio says it will add more adventures over time. \nThere'll be support for cross-play and cross-progression between PS5 and PC. Guerrilla says it'll have more to share about the game in the coming months, but you won't necessarily need to wait a long time to try it out. The first closed playtest will take place later this month. You can sign up through the PlayStation Beta Program.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/guerrilla-reveals-horizon-hunters-gathering-a-co-op-action-spin-off-for-ps5-and-pc-162058264.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-launches-four-new-standalone-apps-140000686.html?src=rss",
        "description": "ExpressVPN is launching a new cybersecurity suite consisting of four standalone products: a password manager called ExpressKeys, a masked email relay called ExpressMailGuard, an encrypted AI platform called ExpressAI and an app called Identity Defender that monitors public information for any threats to your identity. All four apps are being rolled into ExpressVPN's existing multi-tiered pricing structure.\nExpressKeys and ExpressMailGuard have officially launched and are now available to subscribers. Identity Defender launches for U.S. customers only on February 26. ExpressAI was originally planned to launch today, but ExpressVPN decided yesterday to hold it back in order to refine the experience. Its new launch date remains to be determined.\nExpressKeys and Identity Defender are based on existing products, but they're being relaunched for the new suite. ExpressKeys replaces ExpressVPN Keys, the password manager formerly controlled from the ExpressVPN app. By separating password management into its own app, ExpressVPN hopes to be able to update it more quickly without needing to ship a whole new version of the VPN. Everyone who currently has an Advanced or Pro subscription with ExpressVPN Keys will see it automatically replaced with ExpressKeys.\nIdentity Defender is only available in the United States, and so far only to users who created their accounts after October 28, 2024. Available for Advanced and Pro subscribers, Identity Defender consists of a data removal service, an identity theft insurance policy and a set of crawlers that scan for any suspicious activity around your personal information. Like ExpressKeys, it's transitioning from an integrated VPN feature to a standalone app.\nExpressMailGuard is a service for creating burner email addresses. If you're not comfortable handing over your real email address when creating a new account, you can use MailGuard to generate a fake address that forwards all email to your real inbox. If one of your aliases starts getting a lot of spam, you can cut off its access. It's managed through a separate dashboard that will be available to all ExpressVPN subscribers.\nExpressAI is an AI platform that saves all user-inputted data on strictly encrypted servers. It's apparently end-to-end encrypted, doesn't use your prompts to train its model and never saves uploads on persistent memory. It also has guardrails against processing harmful requests.\nAll these apps are in line with ExpressVPN's usual ethos. They're not innovations; all four can be easily compared to existing products. Instead, like the VPN itself — which rode this model to a spot on my best VPN list — they're focused on performing unsexy tasks well. The ability to bundle them with an ExpressVPN subscription should make them appealing to customers who are already fans of the core VPN product.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-launches-four-new-standalone-apps-140000686.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.\nWhenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.\nWhat is Unpacked 2026 taking place?\nBut first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.\nGalaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n\nSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.\nQualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.\n\nI have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz\n— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025\n\nOne notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.\nThe difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.\nAndroid Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.\nFans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables,  Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.\nGalaxy Buds 4\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.\nEngadget\n\nSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.\nSupport for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.\nGalaxy Z Trifold\nYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.\nGalaxy S26 Edge\nAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.\nInstead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.\nBixby and other AI features\n\n\nSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.\nThe company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.\nUpdate, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.\nUpdate, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.\nUpdate, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.\nUpdate, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-130000556.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple’s long-rumored foldable iPhone hasn’t been announced yet, but after years of speculation, it seems like this device could finally be coming out soon(ish). Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.\nBut of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.\nHere, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.\nWhen could the iPhone Fold launch?\nRumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.\nMark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.\nSome reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.\nWhat will the iPhone Fold look like?\nCurrent consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.\nWhen unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.\nCAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.\nIf that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.\niPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\nEngadget\n\nDisplay and the crease question\nThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.\nMultiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.\nAccording to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.\nIf Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.\nCameras and biometrics\nCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:\n\nTwo rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)\n\nOne punch-hole camera on the outer display\n\nOne under-display camera on the inner screen\n\nSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.\nUnder-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.\niPhone Fold’s hinge and materials\nThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.\nLiquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.\nLeaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.\nBattery and other components \nBattery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.\nThat would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.\nPrice\nNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.\nEstimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.\nDespite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-130000349.html?src=rss",

        "title": "The best fast chargers for 2026",
        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",
        "description": "Fast chargers are no longer a nice-to-have item. With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.\nToday’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.\nWith so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026.\n \nBest fast chargers for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nWhat to consider before buying a fast charger\n \nBefore you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear.\n \nThe reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.\n \nUnfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.\n \nFor frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.\n \nFinally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging.\n \nFast charger FAQs\n \nWhat is GaN?\n \nWhen looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.\n \nDepending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.\n \nDo fast chargers affect battery life?\n \nTechnically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.\n \nWhat's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?\n \nThere isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

        "title": "I tested several cases for the Switch 2 and these are the best",
        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/reviews/691319/best-switch-2-cases",
        "description": "You might find it kind of sad to put your hard-earned Switch 2 into a protective case. To me, it’s freeing. Sure, it can take away from the slick design. But using a case relieves me of the worry that the console will accumulate tons of little scratches, or worse. I’ve tested several types of cases on the Nintendo Switch 2 since it launched in June, including flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I’ve also tested carrying cases that protect the console when it isn’t in use.\nIt didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best, but that hasn’t stopped me from trying new options from brands that are familiar, as well as from companies that aren’t household names. There’s something for everyone — and every budget — below.\nI just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for carrying cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or ideally both.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.\nThe best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nVery secure fit\nMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)\nClever dock adapter\n\nChunky dock adapter\nNot the most affordable case\nFront protection only comes in the $80 tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.95 at Dbrand\n $134.8 $99.8 at Dbrand (Ultra kit)\n $79.99 at Best Buy (Travel kit)\n\nThe least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a set of Joy-Con 2 grips, a rear cover for the console and a small matching piece to adhere to its kickstand, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes one of Dbrand’s skins. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. \nUnfortunately, the protective case makes it impossible to fit the Switch 2 into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into the dock, essentially acting as an extender for it’s USB-C jack. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.\nThe tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent cover that protects the front of your console when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.\nWhen this guide was first published, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without you pressing their magnet-releasing buttons. In other words, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips. We’ve received the tweaked pieces and can confirm that they fix the issue.\nRead my full review of the Dbrand Killswitch case for the Nintendo Switch 2\nRunner-up\nJSAUX Split Protective Case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 $26.99 at Jsaux (with promo code PC0114)\n\nThe Jsaux Split Protective Case is an affordable alternative to Dbrand’s Killswitch, costing $29.99 but with many of the same characteristics. It includes two Joy-Con 2 grips that let you detach them from the system at will, and a transparent shell to clip around the back and the top and bottom edges of the Switch 2. Unlike the Killswitch, however, the Jsaux shell is so thin that the console can still fit into the dock. It also comes with a hard front cover that protect the screen during transit (or just for safekeeping), and it has storage for 10 Switch cartridges on its underside.\nI’ve got minor qualms with Jsaux’s case, which I can overlook given its low price (and may not be an issue for you, anyway); the Joy-Con 2 grips are smaller, and don’t add as much bulk or grip as Dbrand’s Killswitch, but they’re still serviceable. Also, its build quality isn’t as good (for instance, on my review unit, there was a little bit of warped plastic that looks like a raised eyebrow near the power and volume buttons, though it’s hard to say if this affects multiple units). \nLastly, the design of its Joy-Con 2 grips exhibit the same edge case issue that Dbrand’s model initially faced before it issued a free fix to all owners. If you hold the Switch 2 by either Joy-Con and shake the console’s full weight downward, the force may be enough to completely detach it, sending the console down to the ground. In my testing, it was really difficult to get the Switch 2 to fall, so this hopefully shouldn’t impact many people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless.\nJsaux ModCase Ultimate\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $60 at Jsaux\n\nAnother runner-up is the ModCase from Jsaux. The foundation of the accessory pack is the plastic and silicone case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s inside), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a small section on the rear of the case that juts out, and that’s where each of its “mods” can be attached.\nThe basic $29.99 kit includes just a couple of basics: a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those plus several other extras. You get a face plate for the console to protect its screen while not in use, as well as an accessory with a magnet to let you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, for use when the ModCase is installed. It looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution included with the Killswitch. But, hey, it all works as intended performance-wise.\nThe best carrying cases for the Switch 2\nTomtoc FancyCase-G05 Nintendo Switch 2 Slim Case\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $36.99 at Amazon\n $36.99 at Tomtoc\n\nTomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it includes color options that look like ice cream sandwiches.\nThe FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price. While Belkin’s Switch 2 carrying case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is a soft screen-protecting flap that can hold 12 Switch cartridges on the other side.\nRunners-up\nBelkin Charging Case Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 at Belkin\n\nIf you’re willing to spend $100 for a carrying case, the Charging Case Pro from Belkin delivers features that you won’t find in any other model. It improves on last year’s $70 case (mentioned below) with a redesigned 10,000mAh battery that doubles as a stand for the console. Not only can the battery be removed, but it now has a screen that shows the remaining charge and a USB-C port that’s easier to access. Despite the high price, this is a great protective case that builds on what makes the cheaper models good picks, too, with 12 cartridge slots, a small pocket for a Bluetooth tracker, and a slick design.\nWaterField Designs CitySlicker case for Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 at WaterField Designs\n\nSpeaking of pricey cases, WaterField Designs has been making tweaks to its beloved, but pricey CitySlicker case for every major handheld to come along. For fans of the case, or those who are looking for a more premium option, the $129 Switch 2 version doesn’t change what isn’t broken. The City Slicker hugs the console’s curves closely enough to ensure a snug fit with a fleece interior, flanked by two pockets for cables and small accessories — one in front of where the Switch 2 sits, and one behind it. There’s a larger zip-up mesh pocket on its back.\nHigh-quality materials set this case apart from the others on this list, and unsurprisingly are what drives up the cost. It features leather on the flap covering the system and around the front of the case. For the secondary material, you have the option of waxed canvas or ballistic nylon. If you want your Switch 2 to sleep in style, this would make for a great gift to yourself or to another game. However, the City Slicker likely won’t protect your console as much as a tougher zip-up or cover case can. Not to mention, you may prefer a case with more cartridge slots than the five that are punched out of this case’s luxe leather.\nPowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 at Amazon\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n $19.99 at Walmart\n\nPower A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. \nAt just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).\nThis case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $26.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 $26.99 at Belkin\n\nFor $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.\nBelkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.\nThe best grip case for the Switch 2’s handheld mode\nThe Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.\nIf you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.\nThe $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around nearly every nook of the Switch 2, leaving access to its headphone jack, USB-C ports, and speakers (it doesn’t cover up the air vents either because that’d be silly). It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its dock.\nSpigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $19.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 at Spigen\n\nUpdate, February 5th: Verified prices and stock for products mentioned in this post, and added the Belkin Charging Case Pro as a great runner-up protective case. \nDisclosure: In 2023, The Verge collaborated with Dbrand on a series of skins and cases.",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/",
        "description": "Japanese blog Mac Otakara today shared some alleged details about the iPhone 17e and iPad 12, which are both expected to be released within the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 2025, Apple discontinued the iPhone SE and released a new entry-level iPhone 16e. The device features a 6.1-inch OLED display, an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, an Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The iPhone 17e would be the follow-up, spec-bumped model.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, which cites \"reliable sources,\" the iPhone 17e will have a similar overall design as the iPhone 16e. While some previous rumors indicated that the iPhone 17e would have a Dynamic Island, the report said this information is not true and that the device will continue to have a notch like the iPhone 16e.\r\n\r\nA19 chip: This one is no big surprise, but the iPhone 17e is expected to be powered by Apple's A19 chip, up from the A18 chip in the iPhone 16e. This upgrade will result in faster performance and power efficiency improvements.\n\r\n  \nC1X modem: Apple says its second-generation C1X modem for 5G and LTE is up to twice as fast as its first-generation C1 modem in the iPhone 16e. Apple also says the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone to date.\n\r\nN1 chip: Like the iPhone Air, the report said the iPhone 17e will be equipped with Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. In the iPhone Air, the N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and Apple says the chip improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.\nAs for the iPad 12, the report said that device will likely have a similar design as the iPad 11, but with a newer A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence. That means the iPad 12 would have 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPad 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate report from Macwelt, available in English on Macworld, cites a source who said that Apple plans to announce the iPhone 17e with a press release on an unusual date: Thursday, February 19. The publication agreed that the iPhone 17e will not have a Dynamic Island, but they do expect the device to feature MagSafe, as previously rumored.\n\r\n  \nMagSafe: Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 17e will reportedly feature MagSafe for up to 20W-25W magnetic wireless charging. The iPhone 16e is limited to Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W speeds. You would also be able to magnetically attach accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wallet to the back of the iPhone 17e.\nMacwelt added that the iPhone 17e will still have a single rear camera.\r\n\r\nApple announced the iPhone 16e on Wednesday, February 19 last year, so the iPhone 17e would be unveiled exactly one year later if this rumor is accurate. It is quite uncommon for Apple to unveil new products on a Thursday, but anything is possible.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundup: iPad\nTags: Mac Otakara, Macwelt, Macworld\nBuyer's Guide: iPad (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"iPhone 17e and iPad 12 Features and Release Date Rumors Surface in Two New Reports\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "We were so busy covering Apple's earnings call last Thursday that iFixit's AirTag 2 teardown video that afternoon went under our radar until now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who have yet to watch the video, iFixit opens up the AirTag 2 and reveals what is new inside, including a redesigned speaker that is up to 50% louder than the one in the previous AirTag, according to Apple. The teardown also provides a look at the AirTag 2's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip and more.\r\n\r\nThe overall design of the AirTag 2 is similar to the original version of the item tracking accessory.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile a previous teardown showed that it is more difficult to remove the speaker in the AirTag 2, compared to the one in the original AirTag, iFixit was still able to disable the speaker's audible chime with the use of a soldering gun.\r\n\r\nFor those who are not familiar, the AirTag is a small accessory that you can attach to your backpack, keys, or other items. Then, you can track the location of those items in the Find My app on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and iCloud.com.\r\n\r\nreleased the new AirTag last month. In addition to the louder speaker, Precision Finding works up to 50% farther away from an item compared to the previous-generation model, and the overall Bluetooth tracking range is also improved.\r\n\r\nRelated Reading: AirTag 2 Hands-On: What's New and Should You Upgrade?\nRelated Roundup: AirTag\nTags: iFixit, Teardown\nThis article, \"iFixit Shares AirTag 2 Teardown, Here's What's New\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/homepod-2-over-3-years-old/",
        "description": "Apple's second-generation HomePod is now over three years old, with no sign of a refresh or third-generation model on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original ‌HomePod‌ was announced at WWDC in 2017 and launched in 2018 after a heavily delayed release. The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.\r\n\r\ndropped its price from $349 to $299 in April 2019 and, in March 2021, the company announced that it was discontinuing the first-generation ‌HomePod‌, instead shifting its focus to the HomePod mini, which launched the previous year. The decision left a gap in Apple's product lineup for a full-sized smart speaker until the company introduced the second-generation model via a press release on January 18, 2023. It launched on February 3, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe second-generation ‌HomePod‌ looks virtually identical to the original, although it is 0.2 inches shorter and has a larger edge-to-edge LED touchscreen on top. It also boasts a range of upgrades and changes compared to its 2018 predecessor, including the S7 chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, a removable power cable, a temperature and humidity sensor, and sound recognition.

        "description": "Our review of the new AirTag went up yesterday, and that involved testing the new Precision Finding feature on Apple Watches. In the process, I found the setup to be confusing and counterintuitive, and was relieved to discover it wasn’t just me. If, like me, you’ve been trying to set up Precision Finding on your Apple Watch for the AirTag you’ve just unboxed and attached to a precious belonging, here are the exact steps to take. \nFirst, make sure your Apple Watch is compatible with the feature. That means verifying you’re using the Series 9 or later (you would have bought it in or after 2023) or the Ultra 2 and newer. Then, go to the Watch app on your phone and do the following to make sure you’ve received the latest software update that adds the functionality.\n\nTap General.\n\nPress Software update. \n\nMake sure the page says you are running watchOS 26.2.1. If not, tap Install Now. \n\nIf you need to download the software, make sure your watch is on its charging cradle. Even though my Apple Watch Series 11 was fully charged, I was still told to make sure it’s connected to power and had at least 50 percent of juice left for the software to install. After a few minutes, my watch restarted and the app said it was updated to the newest version of watchOS. \nNow that you have the right hardware and software, you can set up Precision Finding. I assume you’ve already connected the new AirTag to the iPhone that’s linked to your watch (and if you haven’t, make sure to do that). \nThis was the part of the process that confused me. Instead of opening the Find Items app on the watch, Precision Finding for the new AirTag actually exists as a shortcut in the Control Center. Here are the steps to add it there:\n\nOpen the Control Center by pushing the button below the dial on the side of the watch. \n\nScroll all the way to the bottom and press “Edit.”\n\nPush the + button at the top left of the screen.\n\nScroll down and tap Find Items.\n\nPress Find AirTag, then tap Choose. You should see the new AirTag you’ve linked to your account here.\n\nSelect the AirTag you want to precisely find. \n\nDrag the icon to whichever position you prefer within the Control Center. \n\nHit Done.\n\nNow, whenever you want to locate your item, you can pull up the Control Center, press this button and the Precision Finding interface will appear, showing how far away it is. You can also push the button on the bottom right of this screen to get the AirTag to ring, guiding you to where your item is.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-use-your-apple-watch-to-precisely-find-your-new-airtag-164922731.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Sony has now shipped 92.2 million PlayStation 5 consoles in total around the world, but sales were down sharply over the holiday season compared to last year. In its latest earnings report, the company said it shipped eight million PS5s during its key third quarter, 1.5 million (16 percent) lower than in the same period last year. The gaming division still made more profit, though, thanks to a boost in software sales and a low yen.\nSony’s first two quarters this fiscal year saw an increase in PS5s sold, so the holiday decline is a bit surprising. That said, sales during the same period the previous year were an outlier at 9.5 million units sold, far and away its best period since the console went on sale in November 2020.\nSoftware sales, however, were exceptional in Q3 this year. Sony sold 97.2 million games compared to 95.9 million the year before, and boosted digital sales to 76 percent, up 2 percent year-over-year. Sony said it also saw a record 132 million monthly active users on the PlayStation Network.  New games on the horizon for PS5 include Resident Evil Requiem (February 27), Avowed (February 17) and Bungie’s Marathon (March 5). \nWith PS5 sales down a bit, it does raise the question of when the company’s next console is coming. The PS4 went seven years before being replaced, but given continued strong sales, high RAM prices and recent hardware updates, analysts figure that the PS5 is likely to have a longer life cycle.  When the PS6 does arrive, however, it could offer triple the performance of the PS5. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-holiday-ps5-sales-dropped-16-percent-compared-to-last-year-130000476.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Blizzard is running a series of showcases for several of its major franchises and on Wednesday, it was time for Overwatch to step up to the plate. That’s Overwatch, by the way, and not Overwatch 2. The studio is formally nixing the number from the game's name. \n\"Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world,\" the Overwatch team said in a statement. \"This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the '2' and moving forward as Overwatch.\"\n\n\n\nBlizzard made a big hullabaloo about Overwatch 2 being a sequel to the original game when it went live in October 2022 as part of a shift to a free-to-play model. There were a ton of major changes, not least a format switch from 6v6 to 5v5, with one tank being dropped from each team — a contentious decision that has been walked back with the return of 6v6 modes. \nThe grand vision Blizzard originally had for Overwatch 2 never quite came together. The studio canceled its planned hero missions, which were going to have RPG-like talent trees and long-term progression, but it carried some of that DNA over to the Stadium mode. \nWe only got one round of co-op story missions as well. That paid expansion reportedly sold poorly, leading Blizzard to scrap work on the player vs. environment elements of Overwatch to focus on the competitive player vs. player modes.\nOver the last couple of years, though, Blizzard really seems to have steadied the ship. Overwatch is arguably in the best shape it's been in for a long time. \nThis is shaping up to be a big year for Overwatch. May will mark its 10th anniversary (I have to imagine the team has something significant planned for that). Blizzard laid out much of the roadmap for 2026 during the Overwatch Spotlight showcase. We won’t have to wait long at all to see significant changes to the game. \nNew heroes\n\n\n\nWhen the next season goes live on February 10, it will be the biggest update to Overwatch at least since the Stadium mode and perks system went live last year, and arguably since the dawn of the Overwatch 2 era. That’s partly because Blizzard is adding five new heroes to the mix all at once next week. \nOne of those is a character that the studio said in 2017 it had experimented with but ultimately, um, scratched. Jetpack Cat is alive after all, and is coming to Overwatch in a matter of days.\nThis is a support hero with a permanent flight ability who can \"tow\" an ally, carrying them through the air while healing them. Jetpack Cat's ultimate ability sees the kitty diving into the ground to knock down enemies and tether the closest one to them, she can drag them toward a pit for an environmental kill, for instance. The ultimate is called Catnapper, which is delightful. Also, Jetpack Cat’s primary weapon is called Biotic Pawjectiles. \nI adore her already. It’s fun to see weird Wrecking Ball-type characters coming to Overwatch again. \n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nThe other new heroes joining the fray next week are Domina (a zone-control tank with \"long-range precision\"), damage dealer Emre (a \"fast‑paced, mobile soldier archetype with conflicting identity due to cybernetic modification\"), Mizuki (a support who can throw a hat to heal allies) and Anran (a high-mobility hero who deals fire damage and can self-resurrect with their ultimate). \nAs with Jetpack Cat, the latter of those is aligned with the Overwatch faction. You can try Anran out starting February 5 as part of a hero trial. The other three have ties to the villainous Talon organization. Expect another hero to join the fray every couple of months this year as each new season gets under way. That means more heroes will be added to Overwatch in 2026 than in any year since the game’s debut.\nA \"story-driven era\"\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nThe next season spells the beginning of what Blizzard is calling a \"new story-driven era\" for Overwatch, starting with a year-long narrative arc called The Reign of Talon. All of the lore, heroes, events and so on that emerge over the next 12 months will be tied to the rise of Talon. \nThe studio says this is the \"the first fully connected annual storyline in Overwatch history.\" A new arc will begin next year with Season 1 of 2027 (Blizzard is resetting the season counter when The Reign of Talon begins).\nElsewhere, each role will be split into sub-roles, and the heroes in each will share a passive ability. For instance, \"initiator\" tanks heal more while they're in the air, several damage heroes can detect enemies that are below half health through walls after damaging them and some supports have excess ultimate charge that carries over after you use their most powerful ability.\nAlso on the way soon is a \"meta event\" called Conquest. This is billed as a faction war between Overwatch and Talon that will run for five weeks, with dozens of loot boxes and other rewards (such as some legendary Echo skins) up for grabs. \n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nBlizzard has overhauled the Overwatch interface too, with updated menus, a new hero lobby, a notification hub and the promise of faster navigation. Stadium will have some updates, such as refreshed ability icons and recommended builds based on global data that will be updated between rounds. Vendetta is joining that mode's roster as well.\nAlong with all the new heroes and other updates, a Hello Kitty collaboration will run for two weeks starting on February 10 with themed cosmetics for several heroes. Lots of other cosmetics are in the pipeline, including Crimson Wolf weapon skins you can unlock using competitive points, and rainy day and Valentine's items. Shop items from the last six seasons are going into loot boxes, while mythic cosmetics for Mercy, Juno and Mei will be available in Season 1.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment\n\nLooking further ahead, a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Overwatch will arrive alongside Season 2, which will start in April. Some heroes will be getting their second mythic skins, including Ana and Genji. Genji, Hanzo and Sojourn will have mythic weapon skins in the coming months. Two new maps, including a Japan Night one, for the main modes are coming, along with the return of post-match accolades. \nThere’s so much on the way for my go-to game. I don't know how I'm going to be able to take a long-enough break from Overwatch to play cool indies ever again.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/overwatch-will-drop-the-2-as-jetpack-cat-and-four-other-heroes-arrive-on-february-10-184500327.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable iPhone as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a new supply chain report from The Elec, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display. The report says the company is currently testing two options for this outer film: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and clear polyimide (CPI).\r\n\r\nMost of today's foldable displays use ultra-thin glass to improve clarity and rigidity, but the glass still requires a flexible polymer film on top to prevent scratches and damage. This is the layer that users actually touch, making it a key factor in overall durability and feel.\r\n\r\nThe Elec says Apple's evaluation of CPI is rooted in a wish to differentiate its approach. CPI is more expensive than PET, but has better surface hardness and scratch resistance.\r\n\r\nKolon Industry has apparently emerged as a potential supplier of the material. The company previously built a mass production line for CPI film after anticipating strong demand from upcoming foldable devices. China-based Lens Technology is expected to supply the ultra-thin glass for the foldable ‌iPhone‌ and will handle bonding the final protective film to the glass.\r\n\r\nTouch ID‌, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the \"C2\" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and ‌‌iPhone 18‌‌ Pro Max later this year.\nTags: Foldable iPhone, The Elec\nThis article, \"Apple Hoping to Outdo Rivals With Tougher Display for Foldable iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Apple reportedly plans to release a new Studio Display this year, and it has once again been rumored that the monitor's maximum refresh rate will be 90Hz.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast \"Upgrade\" claimed that Apple was developing 90Hz display technology that could be used for the next Studio Display, as well as future iPad Air and iMac models. A higher refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhone, iPad, and Mac models with ProMotion support can achieve.\r\n\r\nMacRumors tipster has backed up that claim, based on alleged information from an internal build of iOS 26 that was leaked online. Indeed, they believe the next Studio Display is likely to max out at 90Hz rather than 120Hz.\r\n\r\nApple's existing devices typically have up to 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rates, so 90Hz would be unusual for Apple. However, while there is no explicit confirmation, the tipster claimed that multiple code strings and display controller references in the internal iOS 26 build suggest the next Studio Display will max out at 90Hz.\r\n\r\nThe tipster believes that a 90Hz refresh rate would make sense due to bandwidth considerations. Thunderbolt 5 can support 5K resolution at 120Hz without any compression, but they think Apple likely wants to ensure there will be plenty of remaining bandwidth for connecting other devices and peripherals to the new Studio Display.\r\n\r\nThe current Studio Display has a 60Hz refresh rate.\r\n\r\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman.\r\n\r\nsurfaced in a Chinese regulatory database, and it is likely the Studio Display 2.\r\n\r\nmini-LED backlighting, a higher refresh rate of up to 90Hz or 120Hz, HDR support, and an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: Apple Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display\nRelated Forum: Mac Accessories\nThis article, \"Apple's Studio Display 2 Rumored to Have Up to 90Hz Refresh Rate Instead of 120Hz\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "After celebrating its fifth anniversary earlier this month, the tough-as-nails survival Viking game Valheim is coming to Switch 2 this year. Initially launched as a Steam Early Access game in 2021, Valheim lets you team up with up to nine other players online as you explore a procedurally generated open world inspired by Norse mythology.\nWhether playing alone or with your Viking pals, survival depends on crafting the right gear, building shelters and prevailing in punishing combat encounters. The ultimate aim of the game is to kill various gods dotted around the game's different biomes to be deemed worthy of entering Valhalla. But you can ignore the bosses if you’d rather focus on collecting recipes and cooking up banquets for your fellow bearded adventurers.\n\n\nIf I’m being brutally honest, the Switch 2 version of Valheim doesn’t appear to be much of a looker in the announcement trailer, but it’s technically still an early access game at the time of writing, and you do get support for mouse controls and HD Rumble 2 on Nintendo's console.\nAfter debuting on PC, Valheim later made the jump to Xbox and will also launch on PS5 later this year. There’s currently no release date for that or the newly announced Switch 2 port, but they could arrive at the same time to coincide with the game hitting 1.0.\nValheim was announced during today's third-party-focused Nintendo Direct, in which a bunch of Bethesda games were also confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valheim-is-coming-to-switch-2-this-year-164159284.html?src=rss",

A Switch 2 version was previously announced, but we didn’t have a release date until now.\nIn a few months — on May 12, to be exact — you’ll be able to play the fantastic Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on your Switch 2 (a port of that game for Nintendo’s system was also announced last year). And then, later this year, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will arrive on the console. Let’s just hope Bethesda has properly optimized that for Switch 2.\nOf course, these aren’t the first Bethesda games to land on Nintendo systems. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has long been available for the Switch. A Switch 2 version arrived in December.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-get-switch-2-release-dates-150023624.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",
        "description": "Cameras had an interesting year in 2025, with the launch of some long-delayed models like Sony’s 61MP RX1III, wholly original cameras (the Fujifilm X Half and Sigma BF) and much anticipated updates like the Sony A7 V and Canon R6 III. All told, there were 27 new cameras launched last year that joined the 20 new models on the market from 2024.\nThose ranged from compacts to mirrorless to very high-end models, with every price range included. The question is, which one is right for the type of videography or photography you do? Whether you’re an aspiring action or wildlife photographer, an extreme sports junkie or a content creator, we’ll help you find the perfect camera to match your budget and requirements.\n \nBest cameras for 2026\n \nBest mirrorless cameras\n \nMirrorless is the largest camera category in terms of models available, so it’s the best way to go if you’re looking for something with the most advanced features. Canon and Nikon recently announced they’re discontinuing development of new DSLRs, simply because most of the advantages of that category are gone, as I detailed in a video. The biggest selling feature of a mirrorless camera is the ability to change lenses depending on the type of shooting you want to do.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nBest action camera or gimbal camera\n \nThe most important features to look for in an action cam are image quality, stabilization and battery life. GoPro has easily been beating all rivals recently in all those areas, but DJI has taken a lot of its business with the Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nBest compact camera\n \nThis category has fewer cameras than it did even a few years ago and many models are older, as manufacturers focus instead on mirrorless models. However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.\n \nCompacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nWhat to consider before choosing a camera\n \nSmartphones might get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.\n \nSensor size\n \nThere are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.\n \nFull frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject's eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.\n \nThe next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm's X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It's cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it's ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.\n \nMicro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.\n \nThe other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That's used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).\n \nAutofocus\n \nFor photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.\n \nDisplays\n \nThe electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.\n \nLenses\n \nDSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you're stuck with what's built into a compact camera. While that's great for portability, a single lens means you're going to sacrifice something along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it's slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.\n \nWhen choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.\n \nVideo recording\n \nWhen it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.\n \nIn addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it's preferable to have both.) How's the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

        "title": "The best digital frames for 2026",
        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html?src=rss",
        "description": "A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.\nThat’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display.\n \nBest digital picture frames for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nWhat to look for in digital picture frames\n \nWhile a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.)\n \nBut after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles.\n \nA lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one.\n \nPerhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot.\n \nOther things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method.\n \nAnother important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order.\n \nWhile some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones.\n \nHow much should you spend on a digital picture frame\n \nFor a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality.\n \nDigital frames FAQs\n \nAre digital photo frames a good idea?\n \nYes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice.\n \nCan you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere?\n \nMost modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.\n \nGeorgie Peru contributed to this report.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html?src=rss",

        "description": "The Pixel 10a is official, though details are limited. On Wednesday, Google posted a teaser video showing the mid-range phone dancing around colorful backgrounds. You can pre-order the Pixel 10a on February 18.\n \nGoogle hasn't yet revealed the phone's specs. In the short video, we can see a blue model that's virtually indistinguishable on the outside from the Pixel 9a. And alleged leaks point to a phone with few changes on the inside. That (unconfirmed) list includes a 6.285-inch display, dual rear cameras (48MP wide and 13MP ultra-wide) and a 5,100mAh battery.\n \n\n \n \n \n \nThe teaser's tagline appears to be an attempt to assure Pixel fans that there will, in fact, be meaningful upgrades. \"A phone with more in store, in store soon,\" it reads. Hopefully, its pricing and specs will be \"in store\" for us soon as well.\n \nIn the meantime, you can visit the Google Pixel website to register for more info.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/you-can-pre-order-the-pixel-10a-on-february-18-180712018.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/mistral-drops-voxtral-transcribe-2-an-open-source-speech-model-that-runs-on",
        "description": "Mistral AI, the Paris-based startup positioning itself as Europe's answer to OpenAI, released a pair of speech-to-text models on Wednesday that the company says can transcribe audio faster, more accurately, and far more cheaply than anything else on the market — all while running entirely on a smartphone or laptop.\nThe announcement marks the latest salvo in an increasingly competitive battle over voice AI, a technology that enterprise customers see as essential for everything from automated customer service to real-time translation. But unlike offerings from American tech giants, Mistral's new Voxtral Transcribe 2 models are designed to process sensitive audio without ever transmitting it to remote servers — a feature that could prove decisive for companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and defense.\n\"You'd like your voice and the transcription of your voice to stay close to where you are, meaning you want it to happen on device—on a laptop, a phone, or a smartwatch,\" Pierre Stock, Mistral's vice president of science operations, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"We make that possible because the model is only 4 billion parameters. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere.\"\nMistral splits its new AI transcription technology into batch processing and real-time applications\nMistral released two distinct models under the Voxtral Transcribe 2 banner, each engineered for different use cases.\n\nVoxtral Mini Transcribe V2 handles batch transcription, processing pre-recorded audio files in bulk. The company says it achieves the lowest word error rate of any transcription service and is available via API at $0.003 per minute, roughly one-fifth the price of major competitors. The model supports 13 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and several European languages.\n\nVoxtral Realtime, as its name suggests, processes live audio with a latency that can be configured down to 200 milliseconds — the blink of an eye. Mistral claims this is a breakthrough for applications where even a two-second delay proves unacceptable: live subtitling, voice agents, and real-time customer service augmentation.\n\nThe Realtime model ships under an Apache 2.0 open-source license, meaning developers can download the model weights from Hugging Face, modify them, and deploy them without paying Mistral a licensing fee. For companies that prefer not to run their own infrastructure, API access costs $0.006 per minute.\nStock said Mistral is betting on the open-source community to expand the model's reach. \"The open-source community is very imaginative when it comes to applications,\" he said. \"We're excited to see what they're going to do.\"\nWhy on-device AI processing matters for enterprises handling sensitive data\nThe decision to engineer models small enough to run locally reflects a calculation about where the enterprise market is heading. As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.\nStock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: \"It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.\"\nMistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. \"All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,\" Stock said.\nThe company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement. Context biasing allows customers to upload a list of specialized terminology — medical jargon, proprietary product names, industry acronyms — and the model will automatically favor those terms when transcribing ambiguous audio. Unlike fine-tuning, which requires retraining the model, context biasing works through a simple API parameter.\n\"You only need a text list,\" Stock explained. \"And then the model will automatically bias the transcription toward these acronyms or these weird words. And it's zero shots, no need for retraining, no need for weird stuff.\"\nFrom factory floors to call centers, Mistral targets high-noise industrial environments\nStock described two scenarios that capture how Mistral envisions the technology being deployed.\nThe first involves industrial auditing. Imagine technicians walking through a manufacturing facility, inspecting heavy machinery while shouting observations over the din of factory noise. \"In the end, imagine like a perfect timestamped notes identifying who said what — so diarization — while being super robust,\" Stock said. The challenge is handling what he called \"weird technical language that no one is able to spell except these people.\"\nThe second scenario targets customer service operations. When a caller contacts a support center, Voxtral Realtime can transcribe the conversation in real time, feeding text to backend systems that pull up relevant customer records before the caller finishes explaining the problem.\n\"The status will appear for the operator on the screen before the customer stops the sentence and stops complaining,\" Stock explained. \"Which means you can just interact and say, 'Okay, I can see the status. Let me correct the address and send back the shipment.'\"\nHe estimated this could reduce typical customer service interactions from multiple back-and-forth exchanges to just two interactions: the customer explains the problem, and the agent resolves it immediately.\nReal-time translation across languages could arrive by the end of 2026\nFor all the focus on transcription, Stock made clear that Mistral views these models as foundational technology for a more ambitious goal: real-time speech-to-speech translation that feels natural.\n\"Maybe the end goal application and what the model is laying the groundwork for is live translation,\" he said. \"I speak French, you speak English. It's key to have minimal latency, because otherwise you don't build empathy. Your face is not out of sync with what you said one second ago.\"\nThat goal puts Mistral in direct competition with Apple and Google, both of which have been racing to solve the same problem. Google's latest translation model operates at a two-second delay — ten times slower than what Mistral claims for Voxtral Realtime.\nMistral positions itself as the privacy-first alternative for enterprise customers\nMistral occupies an unusual position in the AI landscape. Founded in 2023 by alumni of Meta and Google DeepMind, the company has raised over $2 billion and now carries a valuation of approximately $13.6 billion. Yet it operates with a fraction of the compute resources available to American hyperscalers — and has built its strategy around efficiency rather than brute force.\n\"The models we release are enterprise grade, industry leading, efficient — in particular, in terms of cost — can be embedded into the edge, unlocks privacy, unlocks control, transparency,\" Stock said.\nThat approach has resonated particularly with European customers wary of dependence on American technology. In January, France's Ministry of the Armed Forces signed a framework agreement giving the country's military access to Mistral's AI models—a deal that explicitly requires deployment on French-controlled infrastructure.\nData privacy remains one of the biggest barriers to voice AI adoption in the enterprise. For companies in sensitive industries — finance, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance — sending audio data to external cloud servers is often a non-starter. The information needs to stay either on the device itself or within the company's own infrastructure.\nMistral faces stiff competition from OpenAI, Google, and a rising China\nThe transcription market has grown fiercely competitive. OpenAI's Whisper model has become something of an industry standard, available both through API and as downloadable open-source weights. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all offer enterprise-grade speech services. Specialized players like Assembly AI and Deepgram have built substantial businesses serving developers who need reliable, scalable transcription.\nMistral claims its new models outperform all of them on accuracy benchmarks while undercutting them on price. \"We are better than them on the benchmarks,\" Stock said. Independent verification of those claims will take time, but the company points to performance on FLEURS, a widely used multilingual speech benchmark, where Voxtral models achieve word error rates competitive with or superior to alternatives from OpenAI and Google.\nPerhaps more significantly, Mistral's CEO Arthur Mensch has warned that American AI companies face pressure from an unexpected direction. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mensch dismissed the notion that Chinese AI lags behind the West as \"a fairy tale.\"\n\"The capabilities of China's open-source technology is probably stressing the CEOs in the US,\" he said.\nThe French startup bets that trust will determine the winner in enterprise voice AI\nStock predicted that 2026 would be \"the year of note-taking\" — the moment when AI transcription becomes reliable enough that users trust it completely.\n\"You need to trust the model, and the model basically cannot make any mistake, otherwise you would just lose trust in the product and stop using it,\" he said. \"The threshold is super, super hard.\"\nWhether Mistral has crossed that threshold remains to be seen. Enterprise customers will be the ultimate judges, and they tend to move slowly, testing claims against reality before committing budgets and workflows to new technology. The audio playground in Mistral Studio, where developers can test Voxtral Transcribe 2 with their own files, went live today.\nBut Stock's broader argument deserves attention. In a market where American giants compete by throwing billions of dollars at ever-larger models, Mistral is making a different wager: that in the age of AI, smaller and local might beat bigger and distant. For the executives who spend their days worrying about data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and vendor lock-in, that pitch may prove more compelling than any benchmark.\nThe race to dominate enterprise voice AI is no longer just about who builds the most powerful model. It's about who builds the model you're willing to let listen.",

        "description": "Without meaningful deterrents, Big Tech companies will do what's profitable, regardless of the cost to consumers. But a new bipartisan bill could add a check that would make them think twice, at least in one area. On Wednesday, Senators Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) introduced legislation that would require social platforms to crack down on scam ads.\nThe Safeguarding Consumers from Advertising Misconduct (SCAM) Act would require platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent fraudulent or deceptive ads that they profit from. If they don't, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general could take civil legal action against them.\nThe bill's sponsors, Ruben Gallego (L) and Bernie Moreno\nRuben Gallego / Bluesky / Bernie Moreno\n\nThe backdrop to the SCAM Act is a Reuters report from last November. Meta reportedly estimated that up to 10 percent of its 2024 revenue came from scam ads. The company is said to have calculated that as much as $16 billion of its revenue that year was from scams, including \"fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products.\"\nMaking matters worse, Meta reportedly refused to block small fraudsters until their ads were flagged at least eight times. Meanwhile, bigger spenders were said to have accrued at least 500 strikes without being removed. Executives reportedly wrestled with how to get the problem under control — but only without affecting the company’s bottom line. At one point, managers were told not to take any action that could cost Meta more than 0.15 percent of its total revenue. (See what I mean about needing meaningful deterrents?)\nAccording to the FTC and noted in the text of the bill, Americans’ estimated total loss from fraud in 2024 (adjusted for underreporting) was nearly $196 billion. An estimated $81.5 billion of that came from seniors.\n\"If a company is making money from running ads on their site, it has a responsibility to make sure those ads aren't fraudulent,\" Sen. Gallego said in a statement. \"This bipartisan bill will hold social media companies accountable and protect consumers' money online.\"\n\"It is critical that we protect American consumers from deceptive ads and shameless fraudsters who make millions taking advantage of legal loopholes,\" Moreno added. \"We can't sit by while social media companies have business models that knowingly enable scams that target the American people.\"\nCorrection, February 5, 2026, 8:18AM ET: This story originally stated that Americans’ estimated loss from fraud in 2024 was $19 billion. It was nearly $196 billion.

        "description": "The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, has prohibited Amazon from continuing its practice of using mechanisms to control the prices charged by sellers on its platform in the country. Germany’s competition regulator explained that the company uses “various price control mechanisms” to review prices set by third-party Markerplace sellers. If the website deems a specific listing’s pricing as too high, it allegedly removes the listing altogether or prevents it from being prominently displayed in the Buy Box section that lets you quickly purchase items. If those listings aren’t removed completely, they’re banished to less prominent sections like in the “See all buying options” and the “Other sellers on Amazon” lists. This reduced visibility could “lead to significant losses in sales” for sellers. \nAmazon was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, because the company itself runs its own retail business and sells goods on the platform. That makes third-party sellers, which make up for 60 percent of the items sold on the website, direct competitors. Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said Amazon must only be allowed to influence competitors’ pricing “in the most exceptional cases,” such as “in the event of excessive pricing.” He didn’t specify what the agency views as “excessive pricing,” but he said allowing the company to continue its current practices will give it the power to “control the price level on the trading platform according to its own ideas.” He also said that Amazon could use its mechanisms “to compete with the rest of the online retail sector outside”of its own website. Amazon’s interference could lead to third-party sellers “no longer being able to cover their own costs, forcing them out of the Marketplace,” he added. \nRocco Bräuniger, Amazon’s country manager for Germany, told Bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling and will continue operating as usual. “Amazon would be the only retailer in Germany forced to highlight non-competitive prices for customers,” he said. ”This makes no sense for customers, sales partners, or competition.” He also asserted that the office’s decision will throttle innovation in the European Union. \nAmazon has been under scrutiny in Europe for years now. Back in 2022, it pledged not to use private sellers’ data to compete with them in the Marketplace in the EU. It also promised to give sellers \"equal treatment” when ranking them in the Buy Box section. \n“The Bundeskartellamt considers this systematic interference in the Marketplace sellers’ freedom to set their own prices to constitute an abuse under the special provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) as well as a violation of the general abuse provisions under Section 19 GWB and Article 102 TFEU,” the agency wrote. “…In these proceedings, the Bundeskartellamt has worked closely with the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act).”\nThe agency is slapping Amazon with a fine due to those violations, but the $70 million penalty it’s asking for is merely partial payment based on the economic benefits the company enjoyed from its alleged anti-competitive behaviors. According to the Bundeskartellamt, the identified antitrust violations are still ongoing, so Amazon may have to pay more. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-germany-fined-70-million-for-influencing-third-party-marketplace-pricing-140000588.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Roblox launched an open-source AI model that generates 3D objects on the fly early last year and now that toolset is getting a massive boost. The platform has introduced a model that whips up \"4D\" objects. I put 4D in quotes because it doesn't actually allow access to the fourth dimension, but rather lets users make interactive 3D objects via prompts.\nAs suggested, these aren't static 3D models. They are fully functional and interactive objects that move and react to players. The beta toolset can't be used to make anything, as it's rather limited for now. There are just two templates for users to choose from. Folks can make cars and solid 3D objects, like a box or a sculpture.\n\nRoblox \n\nThe cars are fully driveable, however, and are made from five separate parts. The parts work independently of one another, allowing for spinning wheels and opening doors. The company says the physics should be accurate, so prepare for a whole lot of user-generated racing games.\nThere's already a game on the platform that uses the 4D tools called Wish Master. It lets players generate cars, planes and all kinds of other stuff.\n\nRoblox \n\nAs for those limited templates, Roblox says it plans to eventually let creators make their own but didn't release a timetable for this. It also says it is developing technology that will generate 3D models based on a reference image.\nToday's open beta comes after Roblox found itself at the center of lawsuits and investigations related to child safety. This led the company to implement mandatory facial verification to access chat, which has reportedly not been going very well. Some countries have actually banned the platform in an effort to protect children.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/robloxs-4d-creation-toolset-is-now-available-in-open-beta-191510664.html?src=rss",

        "description": "A broad new smartphone test has found that Apple devices lead the industry for battery life, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max ranking as the longest-lasting phone tested and Apple tied as the top overall brand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCNET this week published the results of a large-scale battery-life comparison based on testing conducted throughout 2025 across 35 smartphones sold in the United States. According to the report, Apple and OnePlus ranked as the two brands with the strongest battery performance overall, based on averaged results from multiple battery benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThe top-performing individual device in the testing was Apple's ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max, which finished first overall despite not having the largest battery capacity among the tested phones. It has a battery capacity of 5,088 mAh, and its extended battery life is largely attributed to silicon efficiency and software optimization.\r\n\r\niPhone 17 tied for second place alongside the OnePlus 15. The ‌iPhone 17‌ achieved this ranking despite having the smallest battery capacity among the top-performing phones. The Poco F7 Ultra placed third, while the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ placed fourth in the overall rankings. \r\n\r\nCNET's methodology included standardized tests using two benchmarks designed to minimize real-world variability. The first involved streaming video over Wi-Fi at full brightness for three hours, while the second was a 45-minute endurance test that included gaming, video streaming, social media scrolling, and a video call. Results from both tests were averaged to determine final rankings.\r\n\r\niPhone 16e. The publication noted that Google's Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro Fold also performed well in this specific test, along with Motorola's Razr.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: iPhone 16e, iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro\nTags: Battery Life, CNET\nBuyer's Guide: iPhone 16e (Caution), iPhone 17 (Neutral), iPhone 17 Pro (Neutral)\nRelated Forum: iPhone\nThis article, \"iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. Android Battery Life: New Test Reveals Winner\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "The groundhog has predicted six more weeks of winter, which means more time indoors on our devices — and that means it's a great time to improve your cybersecurity. By subscribing to a virtual private network (VPN) and connecting every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe.\nWe strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.\n\nEven with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy.\nBest VPN deals\n\n\nExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.\nExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually.\nNordVPN Basic — $64.56 for a two-year subscription (76 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year.\nNordVPN Plus — $76.56 for a two-year subscription (78 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year.\nhide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for.\nWindscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap).\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nPractically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html?src=rss",

The promo price comes out to $2.29 per month, or $62 for the first 27 months.\nWe’ve generally liked Surfshark as a straightforward, speedy service for everyday use, and it’s one of the picks in our guide to the best VPNs. In our Surfshark review, we found it delivered excellent speeds overall and reliably unblocked Netflix across most of our test servers, which makes this long-term deal worth a look if you want a VPN deal that also includes extras like antivirus, breach alerts and private search.\n\nIn our Surfshark review, the VPN stood out for its excellent performance and approachable design, especially for people who want strong protection without constantly tweaking settings. During testing, it delivered some of the fastest speeds we’ve seen from a major VPN, with average download speeds dropping by just over five percent worldwide. Upload speeds also held up well, making it a solid option for streaming, browsing and everyday use. We gave Surfshark an overall score of 87 out of 100 and called it one of the best VPNs for casual users.\nThis deal focuses on the Surfshark One plan, which bundles the VPN with a suite of extra security tools. In addition to the VPN itself, you get Alternative ID for masking your email and personal details, antivirus protection, breach monitoring through Surfshark Alert and a private search engine. It also supports unlimited simultaneous device connections, so you can protect all of your devices with a single subscription.\nRight now, the Surfshark One plan is discounted by 86 percent, bringing the price down to $67 total for two years plus three extra months. That works out to $2.49 per month for the first 27 months, billed upfront, with a 30-day money-back guarantee if you change your mind. \nIf you want to compare it against other top services before committing, you can also check out our full Surfshark VPN review and our best VPN guide to see how it stacks up.

        "description": "Canon released its first PowerShot camera back in 1996 with a 0.5-megapixel sensor, helping kickstart the digital photo revolution. To celebrate that 30-year anniversary, the company has unveiled a Limited Edition version of its still-popular PowerShot G7 X III compact camera. It has a few unique touches but is otherwise the same as the original model released nearly seven years ago.\nThe limited edition model has a new “graphite” color with a knurled front ring designed to exude “luxury and quality,” Canon wrote. It also carries 30 year anniversary logo printed on the body “to create a special feeling suitable for limited edition models,” the company added in the most Canon-y way possible. \nAs a reminder, the G7 X III was one of the first cameras announced specifically as a model for vloggers, thanks to its ability to shoot vertical video for Instagram. It features a 20.1MP sensor, flip-up 3-inch touchscreen, 24-100mm f/1.8-2.8 zoom lens and a microphone input. It supports 4K 30 fps video with no cropping and can shoot 1080p at 120 fps. The piece de resistance is direct streaming to YouTube directly over Wi-Fi, then a new thing but now a common feature. It originally retailed for $749. \nThe G7 X III had been in short supply until recently, but used models became popular with influencers several years ago and started selling way above list price. Possibly because of that viral fame, Canon announced in August 2025 that it was increasing production and the G7 X III started returning to stock a few months later priced at $880. \nThe Limited Edition G7 X III is selling for a lot more than that at $1,299, though it does come with a limited edition Peak Design cuff wrist strap and 32GB SD card. If you want to one-up the influencers and grab one, shipping will start in April 2026. \nAlong with the camera, Canon announced a pair of interesting new RF-mount full-frame lenses. The first is the ultra wide angle RF 14mm f/1.4 L VCM prime model priced at $2,599, promising bright, high quality optics. The other is a very interesting $1,899 RF7-14mm f/2.8-3.5 L Fisheye STM zoom lens with up to a 190 degree perspective at the widest setting. \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-unveils-a-limited-edition-version-of-its-popular-g7-x-iii-compact-camera-040000700.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Egyptian regulators have banned Roblox, a popular children's video game, Bloomberg reports. The nation's Supreme Council for Media Regulation is coordinating with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority on the decision to ensure its enforcement.\nThe state-owned outlet reported that Senator Walaa Hermas Radwandid had proposed regulation of the platform to “protect children’s moral and educational values.\" The senator outlined his concerns with the nature of the Roblox platform, including the ability to communicate directly with strangers as well as \"potential psychological and behavioral effects on young users.\" In a statement to Bloomberg, Roblox stated that it has \"built rigorous safeguards that go beyond those of many other platforms.\"\n\nEgypt joins others including Iraq, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that have banned or heavily restricted the US-based gaming platform; Turkey and Russia also enacted blanket bans on Roblox recently, citing the \"promotion of homosexuality\" and \"LGBT propaganda.\"\nRoblox has a significant presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The company's most recent economic impact report claims it added $15 million to total GDP across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Qatar and the UAE between 2021 and 2024.\nRoblox recently tightened its age verification requirements for certain in-game features following pressure from numerous US state attorneys general over child safety, though the new system is reportedly a mess.\nAll of this comes against the backdrop of globally internet restrictions, especially for social media services. A raft of nations including Australia, Spain and Denmark have moved to ban social media entirely for children.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/egypt-to-block-roblox-for-all-users-161343443.html?src=rss",

        "description": "You have the best chance to save on streaming services during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that's worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the Disney+ Hulu bundle (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).\n \nWe'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.\n \n\n \n \nDisney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.\n \nHulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.\n \nThe Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.\n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-one-month-of-the-disney-and-hulu-bundle-for-only-10-192814218.html?src=rss",

        "description": "You will have to wait a bit longer before you can buy a Steam Machine — and you may have to pay more for one, too. Valve had intended to release the console-style SteamOS-powered device in early 2026, and AMD CEO Lisa Su just claimed that the company was on track to start shipping it soon. But in a new post detailing the latest updates for its upcoming Steam products, Valve has revealed that while it’s still aiming to start selling the console in the first half of the year, it has yet to decide on concrete pricing and a launch date for it. The release of Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset and controller will be delayed, as well.\nValve was hoping to be able to announce pricing and launch dates by now. The company cited industry-wide memory and storage shortages, which have grown since the Steam devices’ announcement, as the culprit for the delay. It explained that it has to rethink their exact shipping schedules and pricing due to the limited availability and the rising prices of those components. “We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible,” Valve wrote. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the artificial intelligence industry has been hoovering up manufacturers’ available memory chips and hard drives for its infrastructure developments. That has led to shortages for other industries, like PCs and phones. \nThe Steam Machine is a compact cube-like PC for gaming powered by a semi-custom AMD CPU and GPU. Valve said during its announcement that it has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. In the new post, Valve said that majority of Steam titles played great at those settings during testing, though some required more upscaling than others and may fare better when played at a lower framerate to maintain a 1080p resolution. It also revealed that you will have easy access to the Machine’s SSD and memory if you want to upgrade them. Meanwhile, the Steam Frame is a wireless, standalone VR headset that can play both PC and Android games. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html?src=rss",

        "title": "Are VPNs legal?",
        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",
        "description": "VPNs have a mixed reputation, primarily because you can use the technology to hide your location and identity on the internet. Even the best VPNs can be used to conceal crimes and make the perpetrators harder to track. Fortunately, most of the world's governments (at least for now) recognize that VPNs are just technology that can be used for good or ill.\nThat means VPNs are legal in almost every country in the world. The countries that do restrict VPNs tend to be those where internet freedoms are already curtailed, like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. There are distinct gradations between those nations, though. And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.\nIs it legal to use a VPN?\nThe answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. \nIn the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with age verification laws for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could circumvent the OSA by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began trying to ban VPNs as well. The same thing is currently happening in France. In the US, Wisconsin and Michigan are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.\nFor now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one Swiss proposal that would have forced Proton VPN to relocate.\nIn countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.\nWhere are VPNs illegal?\nThis section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.\nOne more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.\nCountries where VPNs are totally banned\nVPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — Belarus, Turkmenistan and North Korea — are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. Iraq, while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.\nUganda is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first social media tax, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like NordVPN) you're good to go.\nCountries where only approved VPNs are allowed\nMore common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.\nThe nations that handle VPNs this way are China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey and Oman. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.\nChina in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.\nRussia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.\nCountries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websites\nIn a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, \"Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,\" but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include Vietnam, Egypt and the UAE. \nPotential future VPN bans\nToday, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to \"think of the children!\" If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. \nVPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.\nFor now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives before they become law. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other cybersecurity ducks in a row while you’re at it.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

The latest iPad mini with the A17 Pro chip is down to one of the best prices we've seen right now — $400, which is $100 off.\n \nApple released this iPad mini in late 2024 and it was a solid update. We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its A17 Pro chip and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage. The model currently on sale comes with 128GB, Wi-Fi and all four color options: Blue, Purple, Space Gray and Starlight. \n \n\n \n \nWe named the Apple iPad mini our favorite compact iPad — though, to be fair, its only competitor is itself. Still, it's a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras. For 20 percent off, it's a great option for a light, useful way to entertain yourself through the rest of winter and beyond. \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ipad-deal-get-100-off-the-latest-ipad-mini-right-now-140900989.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/ai-for-transformation-how-saps-joule-for-consultants-reimagines-project",
        "description": "Presented by SAP\n\nSAP’s AI solution, Joule, has already transformed how business users work — turning siloed data and tasks into intelligent, connected workflows. But consultants on SAP projects face a different set of needs: navigating complex implementations, evolving best practices, and the pressure to deliver faster. They need timely, expert-level guidance. They need an AI partner that can deliver accurate SAP knowledge in an instant. Enter SAP Joule for Consultants, purpose-built to help system integrators and consulting teams drive smarter, faster outcomes for their clients.\n\"The consultant's focus is not using our business applications — it’s to help implement those systems, perform upgrades, and at the largest scale, help our customers transform their on-premises SAP ERP to SAP Business Suite in the cloud,\" says Victor Alvarez, head of product marketing, Joule, at SAP. \"Acting as a knowledge-grounded AI teammate, SAP Joule for Consultants delivers trusted answers at critical moments, guides design decisions, and keeps projects aligned with SAP’s latest best practices.\"\nIt can both compress timelines and improve project execution at every stage of delivery, resulting in a higher quality of service, he adds. \n\"Our customers want to complete their SAP projects as quickly as possible to realize the value of those initiatives sooner,\" Alvarez says. \"SAP Joule for Consultants puts the most accurate and up-to-date information at the fingertips of the consultants and system integrators performing these projects. It helps consultants decide and act with agility, reduce overall costs, and shorten project timelines without sacrificing quality.\"\nBuilding a better AI teammate\nAI is no longer an option in consulting. It’s reshaping how projects are designed, delivered, and scaled. For SAP consulting practices, this shift is especially pronounced as SAP cloud transformation and implementation projects demand deep knowledge and expertise. AI can help surface knowledge in seconds, making consultants more productive and improving project outcomes. As a result, practice leaders are not considering whether to use AI, but which AI solution to put at the core of their delivery model.\nWhat sets SAP Joule for Consultants apart is its underlying knowledge base. Any AI solution can generate an answer. What matters most is if the answer is accurate and can be trusted to guide project execution. SAP Joule for Consultants is grounded in SAP’s most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date knowledge base. The knowledge base is expertly curated by SAP and includes exclusive content not available to third-party solutions or AI-enabled search engines. \n“We recognized an opportunity to help our partners transform their consulting practices with the most reliable AI assistance available,” Alvarez says. “We’ve leveraged our expertise and vast set of non-public customer enablement content to ground SAP Joule for Consultants with the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy knowledge.” \nFor SAP consultants at every level \nConsultants at all experience levels have traditionally spent enormous time searching for information before they can take the next step — whether it’s making an architectural decision that shapes an entire implementation or solving a specific, tactical issue.\nAll that research time is slashed to an extraordinary degree with SAP Joule for Consultants. By delivering expert-level answers drawn from a continually updated knowledge base, the solution helps consultants keep work moving and make smarter decisions that minimize rework.\n\"If you think about cloud transformation, there’s a huge return on investment,” Alvarez explains. “For SAP customers, this ROI goes beyond traditional cloud benefits to also unlock the AI innovations available in SAP Business Suite. SAP Joule for Consultants is part of our commitment to help our customers reduce time to value and achieve AI impact at scale.\"\nEnabling SAP customers too\nThe solution isn't just for consultants; it’s also for the IT departments within SAP customers. Organizations don’t have the luxury of engaging a consultant for every SAP project — sometimes the work needs to, or can be, done in-house. So, in the same way that SAP Joule for Consultants enables consultants with expert-level knowledge, internal IT teams can benefit from on-demand answers and guidance to accelerate internally staffed projects. \n\"They can use SAP Joule for Consultants to access the knowledge needed to take on more complex projects too,\" Alvarez says. \"That opens up more opportunity to engage system integrators on the more strategic and impactful projects.”\nIT teams also benefit from elevated collaboration with their consulting partners. SAP Joule for Consultants helps bridge knowledge gaps that traditionally limit how much internal staff can contribute to and influence project outcomes.\n\"SAP Joule for Consultants makes customers more informed, so that they can collaborate with their consultant partners in a more impactful way,\" he explains. \"It illuminates the nuances of a project, helping clients ask the right questions and participate more actively in critical project decisions to ensure the best possible project outcomes.\"\nPowerful new features coming soon\nSAP Joule for Consultants has been generally available for almost one year, and the demand from both large firms like KPMG and smaller organizations has been tremendous, Alvarez says — a strong validation of its value proposition. The next major milestone is already on the horizon: partner knowledge integration.\n“Our system integrator partners have institutional knowledge that embodies their industry experience and the best practices that distinguish their services and create predictable project outcomes,” he explains. “Soon, they’ll be able to add that institutional knowledge to their instance of SAP Joule for Consultants — creating a single, unified solution that puts both SAP and firm-specific knowledge at their consultants’ fingertips.”\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Over the decades, this reference has provided readers with information about different countries and communities around the world. The post from the CIA announcing the news didn't provide any information about why it will stop offering The World Factbook. The agency was subject to the same buyouts and job cuts that decimated much of the federal workforce in 2025, so maybe this type of public-facing tool is no longer a priority. \nThis reference guide was first published in 1962 as The National Basic Intelligence Factbook.

        "description": "You might have noticed that over the last several years, more and more companies have shifted to a subscription model for their products and services, and Apple has slowly begun to follow suit. As Apple hardware continues to improve, customers are keeping their devices for longer. Meaning that Apple is earning less per customer on their hardware purchases. This has pushed Apple to add more products to its services. Today, Apple offers subscriptions like cloud storage, media, productivity tools, AppleCare, and now products like Creator Studio. This suggests the company is willing to expand subscriptions into areas that were traditionally one-time purchases, a trend that we need to keep a close eye on. The easiest way to see how far Apple has leaned into subscriptions is to simply lay out everything the company currently offers.\nmore…",

        "description": "Despite its supremely sleek design, the iPhone Air actually has a pretty respectable battery life, lasting for somewhere in the region of 27 hours if you’re continuously streaming video. But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.\n \n\n \n \nThis accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the AirPods Pro 3 as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.\n \nAt its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an \"essential accessory\" for some users in his iPhone Air review.\n \nMany Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup. Be sure to check out our guide for those. \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-iphone-air-magsafe-battery-is-cheaper-than-ever-144516608.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Now's a great time to consider upgrading your wireless headphones since you can get our favorites at their best price yet. The Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones are down to $398, which is $62 off and the best discount we've seen since their debut. The sale applies to all three colorways.\n \nThese easily topped our list of the best wireless headphones. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are packed with premium features, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.\n \n\n \n \nThe sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.\n \nThe design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing. \n \nThe only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.\n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones-drop-to-a-record-low-price-175038542.html?src=rss",

If you’re planning to commit to a VPN for the long haul, this pricing makes Proton VPN Plus one of the more compelling options available right now.\n\nIn our Proton VPN review, the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.\nProton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.\nRight now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-two-years-of-access-to-proton-vpn-for-70-percent-off-right-now-123000460.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/the-hidden-tax-of-franken-stacks-that-sabotages-ai-strategies",
        "description": "Presented by Certinia\n\nThe initial euphoria around Generative and Agentic AI has shifted to a pragmatic, often frustrated, reality. CIOs and technical leaders are asking why their pilot programs, even those designed to automate the simplest of workflows, aren’t delivering the magic promised in demos.\nWhen AI fails to answer a basic question or complete an action correctly, the instinct is to blame the model. We assume the LLM isn’t \"smart\" enough. But that blame is misplaced. AI doesn’t struggle because it lacks intelligence. It struggles because it lacks context.\nIn the modern enterprise, context is trapped in a maze of disconnected point solutions, brittle APIs, and latency-ridden integrations — a “Franken-stack” of disparate technologies. And for services-centric organizations in particular, where the real truth of the business lives in the handoffs between sales, delivery, success, and finance, this fragmentation is existential. If your architecture walls off these functions, your AI roadmap is destined for failure.\nContext can’t travel through an API\nFor the last decade, the standard IT strategy was \"best-of-breed.\" You bought the best CRM for sales, a separate tool for managing projects, a standalone CSP for success, and an ERP for finance; stitched them together with APIs and middleware (if you were lucky), and declared victory.\nFor human workers, this was annoying but manageable. A human knows that the project status in the project management tool might be 72 hours behind the invoice data in the ERP. Humans possess the intuition to bridge the gap between systems.\nBut AI doesn’t have intuition. It has queries. When you ask an AI agent to “staff this new project we won for margin and utilization impact,\" it executes a query based on the data it can access now. If your architecture relies on integrations to move data, the AI is working with a delay. It sees the signed contract, but not the resource shortage. It sees the revenue target, but not the churn risk.\nThe result is not only a wrong answer, but a confident, plausible-sounding wrong answer based on partial truths. Acting on that creates costly operational pitfalls that go far beyond failed AI pilots alone.\nWhy agentic AI requires a platform-native architecture\nThis is why the conversation is shifting from \"which model should we use?\" to \"where does our data live?\"\nTo support a hybrid workforce where human experts work alongside duly capable AI agents, the underlying data can’t be stitched together; it must be native to the core business platform. A platform-native approach, specifically one built on a common data model (e.g. Salesforce), eliminates the translation layer and provides the single source of truth that good, reliable AI requires.\nIn a native environment, data lives in a single object model. A scope change in delivery is a revenue change in finance. There is no sync, no latency, and no loss of state.\nThis is the only way to achieve real certainty with AI. If you want an agent to autonomously staff a project or forecast revenue, it’s going to require a 360-degree view of the truth, not a series of snapshots taped together by middleware.\nThe security tax of the side door: APIs as attack surface\nOnce you solve for intelligence, you must solve for sovereignty. The argument for a unified platform is usually framed around efficiency, but an increasingly pressing argument is security.\nIn a best-of-breed Franken-stack, every API connection you build is effectively a new door you have to lock. When you rely on third-party point solutions for critical functions like customer success or resource management, you’re constantly piping sensitive customer data out of your core system of record and into satellite apps. This movement is the risk.\nWe’ve seen this play out in recent high-profile supply chain breaches. Hackers didn't need to storm the castle gates of the core platform. They simply walked in through the side door by exploiting the persistent authentication tokens of connected third-party apps.\nA platform-native strategy solves this through security by inheritance. When your data stays resident on a single platform, it inherits the massive security investment and trust boundary of that platform. You aren't moving data across the wire to a different vendor’s cloud just to analyze it. The gold never leaves the vault.\nFix the architecture, then curate the context\nThe pressure to deploy AI is immense, but layering intelligent agents on top of unintelligent architecture is a waste of time and resources.\nLeaders often hesitate because they fear their data isn't \"clean enough.\" They believe they have to scrub every record from the last ten years before they can deploy a single agent. On a fragmented stack, this fear is valid.\nA platform-native architecture changes the math. Because the data, metadata, and agents live in the same house, you don't need to boil the ocean. Simply ring-fence specific, trusted fields — like active customer contracts or current resource schedules — and tell the agent, 'Work here. Ignore the rest.' By eliminating the need for complex API translations and third-party middleware, a unified platform allows you to ground agents in your most reliable, connected data today, bypassing the mess without waiting for a 'perfect' state that may never arrive.\nWe often fear that AI will hallucinate because it’s too creative. The real danger is that it will fail because it’s blind. And you cannot automate a complex business with fragmented visibility. Deny your new agentic workforce access to the full context of your operations on a unified platform, and you’re building a foundation that is sure to fail.\n\nRaju Malhotra is  Chief Product & Technology Officer at Certinia.\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

        "link": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotifys-page-match-seamlessly-swaps-between-real-books-and-audiobooks-120000819.html?src=rss",
        "description": "I have a love-hate relationship with Spotify that might just be leaning more towards love today. While I struggle with some of the company's choices about the type of content it allows on its platform, I have always had a soft spot for its Wrapped roundups and the monthly audiobook hours included with my Premium subscription. For those like me, Spotify’s news today will likely enhance the appeal of its audiobook offerings. It’s announcing a partnership with Bookshop.org — which lets indie bookstores sell their wares online through a unified platform — allowing users to buy physical books from within its app, and launching a new Page Match feature that helps sync your progress across the physical books you read and the audiobooks in Spotify’s catalog. Also, the audiobook recap feature that summarizes the plot so far is expanding to Android this spring, following its iOS debut (in beta form) last fall.\nPage Match is coming to all places where Spotify’s audiobooks are available, starting with the English language titles in its 500,000-strong library. Meanwhile, you can access Bookshop within the Spotify app in the US and the UK, where Bookshop operates. \nThough I’m thrilled that this will mean easier and greater support of independent bookstores in those areas, I’m more excited by the prospect of Page Match, which I previewed at a recent launch event in the company’s offices in New York. I’m the sort of person who reads the same title in its ebook, physical and audio forms. (I often wish that a purchase of a physical book came with free ebook and audio versions, but that’s besides the point.) \nWhile Kindles currently do a decent job of getting you to your latest page read across various devices, switching between, say, Martha Wells’ All Systems Red on Spotify and the paperback copy is not quite as easy. With Page Match, though, that should get a lot easier. \nHow does Spotify Page Match work?\nWhen you get access to the feature (which is rolling out today), you’ll find the Page Match button under the title of each audiobook. You’ll have to first look up the book on Spotify and tap into its full chapter list to find this, which means the book you want to use has to be one of the hundreds of thousands in the company’s library. Then, tap the green “Scan to listen” button if you’re looking to move over to the audio version or “Scan to read” below it if you’re switching over to a hard copy instead. \nWhichever you pick, you’ll need to enable access to your device’s camera and then scan the page of the book you’re on. This should work on ereaders as well, and appears to be using some form of optical character recognition to match the part of the book to its audio counterpart.\nIf you’re scanning to listen, the process is fairly straightforward. Once you’ve placed the page in the viewfinder, the app will quickly jump to that very spot in the chapter  track. I’ll note that it was hard for me to confirm whether this actually worked during my first demo, since I never felt like I found the words being spoken on the page I was looking at. In this case, it was Lights Out: An Into Darkness novel by Navessa Allen, and I mostly felt like the narration had simply gone past the page I was on, rather than a complete failure. Subsequent attempts with other books, like Stephen King’s It, were more effective. \nThings get a bit trickier when you’re trying to move from audio book to the paper (or ereader). After pressing “Scan to read,” you’ll need to place a page in front of the camera and wait for it to tell you to move forward or backward. Ideally, you’d already know more or less where you were, so you won’t have to flip too many pages. \nIn my demo, because we were a few chapters too far from where we paused in the early part of It, there was a lot more page-turning required to get to the right spot. What I found helpful was the progress bar at the bottom of the screen, which highlighted the correct location and how far away we were from it. The instructions “Move forward” and “Move back” were clear and came up in a timely manner. When we finally landed on the right page, the screen highlighted the specific lines on the page to start from, too. \nI have to caveat this with the observation that there were a few starts and stops during my demo, which were resolved once I established a solid internet connection. And though “Scan to read” did eventually work as promised, there was a bit of flipping around that seemed to be part of the process, which might be tedious and not quite the magical experience some might expect.\nThe good news is that Spotify seems to already be working on even more features to make it easier to read physical books in tandem with listening to audiobooks. The company said it sees “the future of reading as one that’s personalized, flexible, and built to move fluidly across formats and moments. Page Match is an early example of how Spotify is helping shape that future at scale. “\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/spotifys-page-match-seamlessly-swaps-between-real-books-and-audiobooks-120000819.html?src=rss",

        "description": "With the spring approaching, it's time to start thinking about how you'll file your taxes. Unfortunately, with the recent demise of Direct File, there isn't a free, government-provided alternative to TurboTax in 2026, and you'll need to look to other federal programs, including IRS Free File, to file your paperwork. If you don't qualify for Free File, chances are you'll need to dish out cash for Intuit's software. And while we hate to suggest you give money to a company that has spent decades lobbying to ensure America's tax system remains a nightmare, we can at least save you some money if TurboTax is your only option.\n \n\n \n \nRight now, Amazon has discounted the deluxe desktop edition of TurboTax by 44 percent. That gets you $35 off software that normally costs $80, which you can use to file both your individual state and federal taxes. For most Americans, that should cover their needs.\n \nHowever, if you're self-employed, you'll need to pony up for the more expensive Business version of TurboTax, which is currently 42 percent off, or $54 off. One last thing to note: you'll need a PC with either Windows 11 or macOS Sonoma to run the software, so an older machine won't do, unfortunately. H&R Block is having a similar sale on their Deluxe software as well.\n \n\n \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/turbotax-deluxe-is-on-sale-for-only-45-ahead-of-tax-season-204848111.html?src=rss",

We have three possibilities: there's an M5 Pro chip along with an M5 Max and M5 Ultra chip and it's just not added to the iOS 26.3 code yet, Apple is changing its numbering, or Apple is planning for M5 Max and M5 Ultra ‌MacBook Pro‌ models.\r\n\r\n \t\nChip 1 in the beta: T6051, H17C. Presumably M5 Max.\n\r\n \t\nChip 2 in the beta: T6052, H17D. Presumably M5 Ultra.\n\r\n \t\nNot in the beta: T6050, H17S. Chip identifier expected for M5 Pro.\n\r\n\r\nM1 Max (H13C), M2 Max (H14C), M3 Max (H15C/H15M), and M4 Max (H16C). There was also an M variant of the M3 Max for the 14-core chip, with Apple using C for the 16-core chip.\r\n\r\nM1 Ultra (H13D), ‌M2‌ Ultra (H14D), and M3 Ultra (H15D). There was no M4 Ultra chip.\r\n\r\nMac Studio in the M5 family, which would use an M5 Ultra chip, but we haven't heard rumors about an upcoming launch.\nThis article, \"New M5 Chips Spotted in iOS 26.3 Beta\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Aspiring Starlink competitor Logos Space Services has secured FCC clearance to launch more than  4,000 broadband satellites into low Earth orbit by 2035, as reported by Space News. Under FCC regulations, the company must deploy half of the approved amount within the next seven years.\nThe company is headed by its founder, Milo Medin, a former project manager at NASA as well as a former vice president of wireless services at Google. The company has been raising money since it opened its doors in 2023 and reportedly hopes to deploy its first satellite by 2027. Logos’ planned low Earth orbit constellation would beam high-speed broadband internet to customers worldwide, including government and enterprise users, much like Starlink.\n\nWhile the satellite broadband market is growing, Starlink remains the biggest player by far. The European Space Agency estimates there are just over 14,000 functioning satellites currently in orbit and we know that roughly 9,600 of them are a part of the Starlink constellation. The SpaceX subsidiary recently asked the FCC for clearance to launch a million satellites, though in reality, the FCC will likely trend closer to the 7,500 it approved on the last go-around. The ESA says it expects 100,000 satellites to be in orbit by 2030.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-potential-starlink-competitor-just-got-fcc-clearance-to-launch-4000-satellites-143905076.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Amazon’s next-generation AI assistant is now available to everyone in the US for $20 per month, or for free if you’re a Prime member. Amazon has also introduced a try-before-you-buy free tier for non-Prime members, but it’s limited to text-based chat.\nAlexa+ has been in early access since last year, and Amazon says it’s listened to user insights ahead of rolling out the update nationwide today. If you’re a Prime member, you can start using the new assistant by saying \"Alexa, upgrade to Alexa+\" or by heading to Alexa.com and signing into your Amazon account. The Alexa website is also where you’ll find the new free Alexa chat feature, which lets you ask questions and research various topics with usage limits.\n\nGiven that a Prime membership costs less ($15 per month) than Alexa+ on its own, Amazon is no doubt hoping that the introduction of its now more conversational Alexa assistant will entice some would-be subscribers. Amazon also offers a 30-day free trial of Prime to first-time customers.\nAs well as allowing more complex and naturally flowing interactions, Alexa+ also has new agentic capabilities, making it more effective at managing your schedule, providing recommendations, making reservations and controlling your smart home devices. It’s also a more personalized experience, with the idea being that Alexa keeps an eye on your digital activity so it gives you more useful answers.\nWhether the overhauled Alexa will work for everyone remains to be seen. In our preview last summer, Engadget’s Cherlynn Low wrote about her conflicted feelings on the next-gen assistant.  While impressed by its ability to handle more complex tasks, she found the experience to be inconsistent and \"just incompetent enough to be annoying.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-is-now-available-nationwide-with-a-free-text-based-version-for-non-prime-members-to-try-155550342.html?src=rss",

The affected account holders had their email addresses and phone numbers scraped in a hack that occurred in October 2025.\nIn an email posted on Bluesky, Substack CEO, Christ Best, said the company became aware of the breach on February 3, which involved an \"unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission.\" While internal metadata was also shared in the hack, Best said that credit card numbers and other financial details were not. No passwords were obtained either.\n\nAs well as apologizing to Substack users, the company’s CEO also said in the email that the security vulnerabilities have now been addressed. \"We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,\" he said. Best added that there is no evidence that any of the stolen data is being \"misused,\" but advised the affected account holders to be wary of suspicious emails or text messages they may receive. \nThe newsletter platform has not disclosed how many accounts were hacked, but Bleeping Computer reported that a database allegedly containing 697, 313 stolen data records from Substack was leaked on the hacking forum BreachForums.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/substack-ceo-informs-users-of-a-data-breach-151113809.html?src=rss",
