      "title": "Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 brings 1M token context and 'agent teams' to take on OpenAI's Codex",
      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
      "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-gpt-5-3-codex-drops-as-anthropic-upgrades-claude-ai-coding-wars-heat",
      "description": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.\nThe dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\n\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"\nThat claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI's announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\nOpenAI's new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic's Claude by double digits\nThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.\nThe Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex's 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model's 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic's Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.\nOpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\n\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.\nFrom coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecycle\nPerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI's positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"\nThis expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.\nThe expansion signals OpenAI's ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.\nOpenAI's first 'high capability' cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fund\nThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\n\"While we don't have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.\nAltman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"\nThe company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.\nSuper Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic's advertising campaign 'clearly dishonest' as rivalry turns personal\nThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday's release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI's intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.\nBoth companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”\nThe head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI's recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. \nAltman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"\nHe went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"\nEnterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI's market share faces pressure from Anthropic and Google\nThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.\nAccording to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024's actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.\nThe a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic's share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.\nEnterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company's most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.\nFor software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies' coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.\nBoth AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platforms\nThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\n\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, told reporters this week.\nThis follows Monday's launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.\nTrillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding race\nThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.\nAnthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.\nGPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI's announcement—a reference to Nvidia's latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.\nThe financial pressure adds urgency to both companies' enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.\nOpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop app\nLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.\nThe model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\n\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it's doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"\nThe company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"\nHe concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"\nWhether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What's clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

      "description": "Anthropic has announced that its chatbot Claude will remain ad-free. This is in direct contrast to rival company OpenAI, which recently brought ads to ChatGPT for many users.\nThe company says that \"including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible\" with the chatbot becoming a \"genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The reasoning here is rather simple. People tend to share personal details with chatbots, for better or for worse, and getting ads based on that stuff would be creepy. Imagine asking for mental health advice and getting an ad for St. John's wort or something.\n\n\nAnthropic notes that other conversations \"involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\"\nThe company said that integrating advertising would \"work against\" the Claude Constitution, which counts \"being generally helpful\" as a core principle. \"Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results,\" it writes in a blog post.\nThere are some real world concerns here. AI companies gobble up all money in sight and the returns haven't exactly been stellar. Ads are an easy way to recoup some of that investment, which is likely why OpenAI went that route. Engadget reached out to Anthropic to inquire about any kind of forthcoming financial hurdles that could force it to change course. A representative pointed to today's blog post and said it's \"all the information we have to share at this time.\"\nWe do know that Anthropic remains committed to commerce-based agentic AI. It said it will \"continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare or buy products, connect with businesses and more.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-says-it-wont-bring-ads-to-claude-unlike-rival-chatgpt-171243642.html?src=rss",

      "description": "As OpenAI is making plans to introduce ads to ChatGPT, competitor Anthropic has promised to keep Claude ad-free. In a blog post today, the company said that there are \"many good places for advertising,\" but a \"conversation with Claude is not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Anthropic, including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking. Anthropic claims that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or \"subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\"\r\n\r\nThere will be no ads or sponsored links in conversations with Claude, and Claude's responses will not be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements.\r\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal--the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous--and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\r\nPromising an ad-free experience could encourage people to choose Claude over OpenAI's ChatGPT. In January, OpenAI said that it would start testing ads in the United States for free and Go tier subscribers, though subscribers with higher paid tiers will not see ads. OpenAI claims that ads will be clearly labeled and will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will the company provide conversation details to advertisers.\r\n\r\nTo further reinforce the difference between Claude's ad-free experience and ChatGPT's ad-supported experience, Anthropic plans to run a humorous Super Bowl commercial where a man gets an unwanted cougar dating ad after asking about his mother. \"Ads are coming to AI,\" reads the video's text. \"But not to Claude.\"\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAnthropic plans to continue to monetize through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, with revenue reinvested in improving Claude. Anthropic will maintain a free tier, and the company says that it may also offer lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing in the future if there is demand for it. Claude Pro is priced at $20 per month, which is the same price as ChatGPT's higher-end Plus tier.\r\n\r\nTags: Anthropic, ChatGPT, OpenAI\nThis article, \"Anthropic Promises Claude Will Remain Ad-Free, Mocks ChatGPT Ads in Super Bowl Commercial\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
        "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-gpt-5-3-codex-drops-as-anthropic-upgrades-claude-ai-coding-wars-heat",
        "description": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.\nThe dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\n\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"\nThat claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI's announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\nOpenAI's new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic's Claude by double digits\nThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.\nThe Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex's 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model's 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic's Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.\nOpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\n\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.\nFrom coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecycle\nPerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI's positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"\nThis expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.\nThe expansion signals OpenAI's ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.\nOpenAI's first 'high capability' cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fund\nThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\n\"While we don't have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.\nAltman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"\nThe company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.\nSuper Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic's advertising campaign 'clearly dishonest' as rivalry turns personal\nThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday's release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI's intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.\nBoth companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”\nThe head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI's recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. \nAltman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"\nHe went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"\nEnterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI's market share faces pressure from Anthropic and Google\nThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.\nAccording to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024's actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.\nThe a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic's share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.\nEnterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company's most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.\nFor software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies' coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.\nBoth AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platforms\nThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\n\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, told reporters this week.\nThis follows Monday's launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.\nTrillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding race\nThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.\nAnthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.\nGPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI's announcement—a reference to Nvidia's latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.\nThe financial pressure adds urgency to both companies' enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.\nOpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop app\nLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.\nThe model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\n\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it's doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"\nThe company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"\nHe concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"\nWhether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What's clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

        "description": "Anthropic has announced that its chatbot Claude will remain ad-free. This is in direct contrast to rival company OpenAI, which recently brought ads to ChatGPT for many users.\nThe company says that \"including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible\" with the chatbot becoming a \"genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\" The reasoning here is rather simple. People tend to share personal details with chatbots, for better or for worse, and getting ads based on that stuff would be creepy. Imagine asking for mental health advice and getting an ad for St. John's wort or something.\n\n\nAnthropic notes that other conversations \"involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\"\nThe company said that integrating advertising would \"work against\" the Claude Constitution, which counts \"being generally helpful\" as a core principle. \"Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results,\" it writes in a blog post.\nThere are some real world concerns here. AI companies gobble up all money in sight and the returns haven't exactly been stellar. Ads are an easy way to recoup some of that investment, which is likely why OpenAI went that route. Engadget reached out to Anthropic to inquire about any kind of forthcoming financial hurdles that could force it to change course. A representative pointed to today's blog post and said it's \"all the information we have to share at this time.\"\nWe do know that Anthropic remains committed to commerce-based agentic AI. It said it will \"continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare or buy products, connect with businesses and more.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-says-it-wont-bring-ads-to-claude-unlike-rival-chatgpt-171243642.html?src=rss",

        "description": "As OpenAI is making plans to introduce ads to ChatGPT, competitor Anthropic has promised to keep Claude ad-free. In a blog post today, the company said that there are \"many good places for advertising,\" but a \"conversation with Claude is not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Anthropic, including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking. Anthropic claims that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or \"subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\"\r\n\r\nThere will be no ads or sponsored links in conversations with Claude, and Claude's responses will not be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements.\r\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal--the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous--and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\r\nPromising an ad-free experience could encourage people to choose Claude over OpenAI's ChatGPT. In January, OpenAI said that it would start testing ads in the United States for free and Go tier subscribers, though subscribers with higher paid tiers will not see ads. OpenAI claims that ads will be clearly labeled and will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will the company provide conversation details to advertisers.\r\n\r\nTo further reinforce the difference between Claude's ad-free experience and ChatGPT's ad-supported experience, Anthropic plans to run a humorous Super Bowl commercial where a man gets an unwanted cougar dating ad after asking about his mother. \"Ads are coming to AI,\" reads the video's text. \"But not to Claude.\"\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAnthropic plans to continue to monetize through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, with revenue reinvested in improving Claude. Anthropic will maintain a free tier, and the company says that it may also offer lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing in the future if there is demand for it. Claude Pro is priced at $20 per month, which is the same price as ChatGPT's higher-end Plus tier.\r\n\r\nTags: Anthropic, ChatGPT, OpenAI\nThis article, \"Anthropic Promises Claude Will Remain Ad-Free, Mocks ChatGPT Ads in Super Bowl Commercial\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Meta is developing a standalone app for Vibes, its feed of AI-generated videos, according to reports from TechCrunch and Platformer. Vibes was introduced as a feature in the Meta AI app in September 2025. Similar to OpenAI's Sora app, Vibes lets users prompt Meta AI to create TikTok-style vertical videos.\n\"Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,\" Meta said in a statement. \"We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.\"\nMeta has yet to share specific numbers for how many people actually use Vibes, but the company does claim that Meta AI usage has continued to grow since Vibes launched. Breaking the feature out into its own app could allow Meta to add more functionality without cluttering the existing Meta AI app. The company believes AI-generated content will be the next big source of engagement on platforms, and said in an October 2025 earnings call that it planned to push more AI images and videos into its recommendation algorithm. A dedicated app for creating videos like Vibes could be one way Meta hopes to do that.\nAs Meta's main competitor in the burgeoning field of AI-first social media, OpenAI has continued to iterate on its Sora app, adding ways for characters and pets to cameo in videos, and signing a deal with Disney to allow users to generate content with Disney characters. Considering the company has licensed celebrity likenesses in the past, it doesn't seem impossible that Meta could pursue similar deals. Whatever happens, AI-generated videos appear like they'll be increasingly inescapable.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-giving-its-ai-slop-feed-an-app-of-its-own-192208200.html?src=rss",

Prime members can access Alexa+ by saying \"Alexa, upgrade to Alexa+,\" or by logging into their Amazon account on the Alexa website.\r\n\r\nbeen in testing since February 2025, offering a smarter, more personalized, and more proactive assistant experience. Amazon says Alexa+ is much more capable than the prior version of Alexa thanks to its updated architecture that uses large language models from Amazon Nova and Anthropic.\r\n\r\nAlexa is able to do things like order takeout, make restaurant reservations, book rides, and schedule home repairs, plus it can control smart home products and answer questions like any other chatbot. It integrates with Amazon services, and can integrate with hardware like Ring cameras.\r\n\r\nAmazon Prime in the U.S. is priced at $14.99 per month or $139 per year, and Alexa+ is considered one of the Prime benefits. Customers without Prime can try Alexa+ through a limited, free chat experience on Alexa.com and in the Alexa app. Subscribing solely to Alexa+ costs $19.99 per month, which makes no sense for anyone since Prime is cheaper.\r\n\r\nSiri. ‌Siri‌ is going to get an update in spring 2026, likely in iOS 26.4.\r\n\r\nTag: Amazon\nThis article, \"Amazon's Alexa+ Now Free for All U.S. Prime Members, Beating Apple's Smarter Siri to Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have yet to be shared, but the date is widely expected to be near the end of the month, probably on February 25 But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected when Samsung does hold its next event.\nWhenever it does happen, Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.\nWhat is Unpacked 2026 taking place?\nBut first, when is Unpacked going to happen? A recent image shared by leakster Evan Blass indicated Unpacked should be taking place on “February 25 2026.” Blass has a long history of credible leaks, which means this date is all but confirmed, and the main questions remaining would be — what time and in what timezone? We’re still waiting on Samsung for the official details, which should include answers to those questions.\nGalaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n\nSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.\nQualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.\n\nI have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz\n— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025\n\nOne notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.\nThe difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.\nAndroid Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.\nFans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables,  Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.\nGalaxy Buds 4\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.\nEngadget\n\nSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.\nSupport for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.\nGalaxy Z Trifold\nYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.\nGalaxy S26 Edge\nAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.\nInstead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.\nBixby and other AI features\n\n\nSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.\nThe company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.\nUpdate, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.\nUpdate, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.\nUpdate, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.\nUpdate, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-130000556.html?src=rss",

        "description": "With gaming becoming an ever-smaller part of NVIDIA's lucrative business, the company reportedly won't bother releasing new graphics cards this year. The Information reported on Thursday that NVIDIA has pushed back its plan to release an update to the RTX 50 line in 2026. This would be the first time in three decades that the company hasn't launched new gaming chips. The culprit? Why, AI, of course.\nAI demand has driven the current memory chip shortage, throwing the consumer electronics industry out of kilter. Many product prices are expected to rise (as if tariffs hadn't already done enough damage there). And the scarcity of memory chips has made components that rely on them, including GPUs, nearly impossible to find. Even the auto industry isn't spared.\nFacing those constraints, NVIDIA, which made its bones on graphics chips for PCs and gaming consoles, is essentially brushing off that demographic. The Information notes that in the first nine months of 2022, NVIDIA's gaming GPUs made up 35 percent of its total revenue. During that same period in 2025, only around 8 percent came from gaming components. In addition, NVIDIA's AI chips have much higher profit margins: 65 percent vs. 40 percent for graphics cards.\nThat means gamers, already hard-pressed to find last year's RTX 50 series, likely won't get the expected \"Super\" version in 2026. On top of that, The Information says the delay will also push back NVIDIA's next-gen graphics card (likely \"RTX 60\"). That component was initially expected to begin mass production at the end of 2027.\nBut hey, at least you can shop (and view ads!) in ChatGPT, have a talk with your Gmail inbox and record everything the people around you say. Who needs games anyway, right?\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-reportedly-wont-release-new-graphics-cards-this-year-173002651.html?src=rss",

The affected account holders had their email addresses and phone numbers scraped in a hack that occurred in October 2025.\nIn an email posted on Bluesky, Substack CEO, Christ Best, said the company became aware of the breach on February 3, which involved an \"unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission.\" While internal metadata was also shared in the hack, Best said that credit card numbers and other financial details were not. No passwords were obtained either.\n\nAs well as apologizing to Substack users, the company’s CEO also said in the email that the security vulnerabilities have now been addressed. \"We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,\" he said. Best added that there is no evidence that any of the stolen data is being \"misused,\" but advised the affected account holders to be wary of suspicious emails or text messages they may receive. \nThe newsletter platform has not disclosed how many accounts were hacked, but Bleeping Computer reported that a database allegedly containing 697, 313 stolen data records from Substack was leaked on the hacking forum BreachForums.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/substack-ceo-informs-users-of-a-data-breach-151113809.html?src=rss",

        "description": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.\nThat's left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.\nBut now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. \nEmerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.\nThe tech: moving beyond sequential logic\nMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. \nHowever, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn't just a timeline; it's a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\n\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"\nNEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. \nIt identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.\nThe tokenization trap\nA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the '2', the '.', and the '3' are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It's not like a calculator; you don't always get the right answer because the model doesn't understand the concept of numbers natively.\"\nFurthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn't matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" \nWhile LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.\nOperating at the predictive layer\nRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. \nHowever, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren't trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"\nNEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn't in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. \nWhile tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.\nArchitecture and availability\nThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \n\"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won't work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" \nFundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn't require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.\nAs Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. \nThe company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. \nThis allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. \nDevelopers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.\nThe societal stakes: beyond the bottom line\nWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. \nThe company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. \nBy analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.\nOn the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. \nFinally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn't end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she'd need follow-up care.\"\nPerformance vs. latency\nIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \n\"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn't matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"\nIn contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\n\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"\nAmbitious vision receives big backing\nThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. \nNotable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company's pedigree. \nAnnie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental's model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"\nFundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \n\"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"\nPartnering with AWS\nThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.\nOne of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. \nTo solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer's own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"\nFundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

        "description": "Egyptian regulators have banned Roblox, a popular children's video game, Bloomberg reports. The nation's Supreme Council for Media Regulation is coordinating with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority on the decision to ensure its enforcement.\nThe state-owned outlet reported that Senator Walaa Hermas Radwandid had proposed regulation of the platform to “protect children’s moral and educational values.\" The senator outlined his concerns with the nature of the Roblox platform, including the ability to communicate directly with strangers as well as \"potential psychological and behavioral effects on young users.\" In a statement to Bloomberg, Roblox stated that it has \"built rigorous safeguards that go beyond those of many other platforms.\"\n\nEgypt joins others including Iraq, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the UAE that have banned or heavily restricted the US-based gaming platform; Turkey and Russia also enacted blanket bans on Roblox recently, citing the \"promotion of homosexuality\" and \"LGBT propaganda.\"\nRoblox has a significant presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The company's most recent economic impact report claims it added $15 million to total GDP across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Qatar and the UAE between 2021 and 2024.\nRoblox recently tightened its age verification requirements for certain in-game features following pressure from numerous US state attorneys general over child safety, though the new system is reportedly a mess.\nAll of this comes against the backdrop of globally internet restrictions, especially for social media services. A raft of nations including Australia, Spain and Denmark have moved to ban social media entirely for children.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/egypt-to-block-roblox-for-all-users-161343443.html?src=rss",

        "description": "In the future, Apple users should expect more paid upgrades and subscription bundles just like what the company launched with Apple Creator Studio last month. As said by Mark Gurman in this week’s Power On newsletter, “I believe Apple is looking at all areas of its software and services” for further services monetization opportunities. \nObviously, the appeal of more subscription bundles depends on the particulars. For instance, Apple One has been very popular and seems relatively consumer friendly. But, while Creator Studio is a reasonable deal for hardcore users of Final Cut and Logic Pro, it also introduced exclusive paid features and upsell banners into Apple’s previously free-with-no-asterisks iWork suite of Pages, Keynote and Numbers. \nmore…",

        "description": "Apple expanded its lead in the global tablet market in late 2025 as overall shipments rebounded, according to new research from Omdia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal tablet shipments reportedly reached 162 million units in 2025, representing 9.8% year-over-year growth. The research firm said the strongest momentum occurred during the holiday quarter, when shipments reached 44 million units, also up 9.8% compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Omdia described the annual total as the highest shipment volume recorded since the surge in demand seen in 2020, partly caused by anticipation of memory supply constraints.\r\n\r\niPad and the M5 iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter results increased Apple's market share to 44.9%. This placed Apple well ahead of other tablet vendors during the holiday quarter, with Samsung at 14.7%, Lenovo at 8.8%, Huawei at 6.9%, and Xiaomi at 6.4%. Other manufacturers collectively accounted for the remaining 18.3% of shipments.\r\n\r\nThe report also highlighted changes in how tablets are expected to be positioned in the coming years, including greater emphasis on ecosystem integration and artificial intelligence features:\r\n\r\nOn the product side, we expect a shift in how tablets are positioned and marketed, with vendors framing them as ecosystem-centric devices in a more controlled demand environment. This includes the introduction of cross-OS functionality and a focus on AI-driven experiences. Recent examples include Lenovo's Qira, which operates across Windows and Android to deliver a more seamless user experience and reduce friction between AI assistants. In addition, the collaboration between Apple and Google to use Gemini for future Apple Intelligence features represents a positive step forward for the generative AI ecosystem across its device portfolio, including iPads.\n\r\n\r\nTag: Omdia\nThis article, \"iPad Demand Surges as Apple Strengthens Grip on Tablet Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable iPhone as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a new supply chain report from The Elec, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display. The report says the company is currently testing two options for this outer film: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and clear polyimide (CPI).\r\n\r\nMost of today's foldable displays use ultra-thin glass to improve clarity and rigidity, but the glass still requires a flexible polymer film on top to prevent scratches and damage. This is the layer that users actually touch, making it a key factor in overall durability and feel.\r\n\r\nThe Elec says Apple's evaluation of CPI is rooted in a wish to differentiate its approach. CPI is more expensive than PET, but has better surface hardness and scratch resistance.\r\n\r\nKolon Industry has apparently emerged as a potential supplier of the material. The company previously built a mass production line for CPI film after anticipating strong demand from upcoming foldable devices. China-based Lens Technology is expected to supply the ultra-thin glass for the foldable ‌iPhone‌ and will handle bonding the final protective film to the glass.\r\n\r\nTouch ID‌, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the \"C2\" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and ‌‌iPhone 18‌‌ Pro Max later this year.\nTags: Foldable iPhone, The Elec\nThis article, \"Apple Hoping to Outdo Rivals With Tougher Display for Foldable iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Apple reportedly plans to release a new Studio Display this year, and it has once again been rumored that the monitor's maximum refresh rate will be 90Hz.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 2024, an anonymous listener of the Relay FM tech podcast \"Upgrade\" claimed that Apple was developing 90Hz display technology that could be used for the next Studio Display, as well as future iPad Air and iMac models. A higher refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye, but 90Hz would stop short of the 120Hz refresh rate that iPhone, iPad, and Mac models with ProMotion support can achieve.\r\n\r\nMacRumors tipster has backed up that claim, based on alleged information from an internal build of iOS 26 that was leaked online. Indeed, they believe the next Studio Display is likely to max out at 90Hz rather than 120Hz.\r\n\r\nApple's existing devices typically have up to 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rates, so 90Hz would be unusual for Apple. However, while there is no explicit confirmation, the tipster claimed that multiple code strings and display controller references in the internal iOS 26 build suggest the next Studio Display will max out at 90Hz.\r\n\r\nThe tipster believes that a 90Hz refresh rate would make sense due to bandwidth considerations. Thunderbolt 5 can support 5K resolution at 120Hz without any compression, but they think Apple likely wants to ensure there will be plenty of remaining bandwidth for connecting other devices and peripherals to the new Studio Display.\r\n\r\nThe current Studio Display has a 60Hz refresh rate.\r\n\r\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman.\r\n\r\nsurfaced in a Chinese regulatory database, and it is likely the Studio Display 2.\r\n\r\nmini-LED backlighting, a higher refresh rate of up to 90Hz or 120Hz, HDR support, and an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: Apple Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display\nRelated Forum: Mac Accessories\nThis article, \"Apple's Studio Display 2 Rumored to Have Up to 90Hz Refresh Rate Instead of 120Hz\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "When X's engineering team published the code that powers the platform's \"for you\" algorithm last month, Elon Musk said the move was a victory for transparency. \"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote. \"No other social media companies do this.\" \nWhile it's true that X is the only major social network to make elements of its recommendation algorithm open source, researchers say that what the company has published doesn't offer the kind of transparency that would actually be useful for anyone trying to understand how X works in 2026. \nThe code, much like an earlier version published in 2023, is a \"redacted\" version of X's algorithm, according to John Thickstun, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell University. \"What troubles me about these releases is that they give you a pretense that they're being transparent for releasing code and the sense that someone might be able to use this release to do some kind of auditing work or oversight work,\" Thickstun told Engadget. \"And the fact is that that's not really possible at all.\"\nPredictably, as soon as the code was released, users on X began posting lengthy threads about what it means for creators hoping to boost their visibility on the platform. For example, one post that was viewed more than 350,000 times advises users that X \"will reward people who conversate\" and \"raise the vibrations of X.\" Another post with more than 20,000 views claims that posting video is the answer. Another post says that users should stick to their \"niche\" because \"topic switching hurts your reach.\" But Thickstun cautioned against reading too much into supposed strategies for going viral. \"They can't possibly draw those conclusions from what was released,\" he says. \nWhile there are some small details that shed light on how X recommends posts — for example, it filters out content that's more than a day old — Thickstun says that much of it is \"not actionable\" for content creators. \nStructurally, one of the biggest differences between the current algorithm and the version released in 2023 is that the new system relies on a Grok-like large language model to rank posts. \"In the previous version, this was hard coded: you took how many times something was liked, how many times something was shared, how many times something was replied … and then based on that you calculate a score, and then you rank the post based on the score,\" explains Ruggero Lazzaroni, a pHD researcher at the University of Graz. \"Now the score is derived not by the real amounts of likes and shares, but by how likely Grok thinks that you would like and share a post.\"\nThat also makes the algorithm even more opaque than it was before, says Thickstun. \"So much more of the decisionmaking … is happening within black box neural networks that they're training on their data,\" he says. \"More and more of the decisionmaking power of these algorithms is shifting not just out of public view, but actually really out of view or understanding of even the internal engineers that are working on these systems, because they're being shifted into these neural networks.\"\nThe release has even less detail about some aspects of the algorithm that were made public in 2023. At the time, the company included information about how it weighted various interactions to determine which posts should rank higher. For example, a reply was \"worth\" 27 retweets and a reply that generated a response from the original author was worth 75 retweets. But X has now redacted information about how it's weighing these factors, saying that this information was excluded \"for security reasons.\" \nThe code also doesn't include any information about the data the algorithm was trained on, which could help researchers and others understand it or conduct audits. \"One of the things I would really want to see is, what is the training data that they're using for this model,\" says Mohsen Foroughifar, an assistant professor of business technologies at Carnegie Mellon University. \"if the data that is used for training this model is inherently biased, then the model might actually end up still being biased, regardless of what kind of things that you consider within the model.\" \nBeing able to conduct research on the X recommendation algorithm would be extremely valuable, says Lazzaroni, who is working on an EU-funded project exploring alternative recommendation algorithms for social media platforms. Much of Lazzaroni's work involves simulating real-world social media platforms to test different approaches. But he says the code released by X doesn't have enough information to actually reproduce its recommendation algorithm. \n\"We have the code to run the algorithm, but we don't have the model that you need to run the algorithm,\" he says.\nIf researchers were able to study the X algorithm, it could yield insights that could impact more than just social media platforms. Many of the same questions and concerns that have been raised about how social media algorithms behave are likely to re-emerge in the context of AI chatbots.\"A lot of these challenges that we're seeing on social media platforms and the recommendation [systems] appear in a very similar way with these generative systems as well,\" Thickstun said. \"So you can kind of extrapolate forward the kinds of challenges that we've seen with social media platforms to the kind of challenges that we'll see with interaction with GenAI platforms.\"\nLazzaroni, who spends a lot of time simulating some of the most toxic behavior on social media, is even more blunt. \"AI companies, to maximize profit, optimize the large language models for user engagement and not for telling the truth or caring about the mental health of the users. And this is the same exact problem: they make more profit, but the users get a worse society, or they get worse mental health out of it.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-open-source-algorithm-isnt-a-win-for-transparency-researchers-say-181836233.html?src=rss",

        "description": "We were so busy covering Apple's earnings call last Thursday that iFixit's AirTag 2 teardown video that afternoon went under our radar until now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who have yet to watch the video, iFixit opens up the AirTag 2 and reveals what is new inside, including a redesigned speaker that is up to 50% louder than the one in the previous AirTag, according to Apple. The teardown also provides a look at the AirTag 2's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip and more.\r\n\r\nThe overall design of the AirTag 2 is similar to the original version of the item tracking accessory.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile a previous teardown showed that it is more difficult to remove the speaker in the AirTag 2, compared to the one in the original AirTag, iFixit was still able to disable the speaker's audible chime with the use of a soldering gun.\r\n\r\nFor those who are not familiar, the AirTag is a small accessory that you can attach to your backpack, keys, or other items. Then, you can track the location of those items in the Find My app on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and iCloud.com.\r\n\r\nreleased the new AirTag last month. In addition to the louder speaker, Precision Finding works up to 50% farther away from an item compared to the previous-generation model, and the overall Bluetooth tracking range is also improved.\r\n\r\nRelated Reading: AirTag 2 Hands-On: What's New and Should You Upgrade?\nRelated Roundup: AirTag\nTags: iFixit, Teardown\nThis article, \"iFixit Shares AirTag 2 Teardown, Here's What's New\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Aspiring Starlink competitor Logos Space Services has secured FCC clearance to launch more than  4,000 broadband satellites into low Earth orbit by 2035, as reported by Space News. Under FCC regulations, the company must deploy half of the approved amount within the next seven years.\nThe company is headed by its founder, Milo Medin, a former project manager at NASA as well as a former vice president of wireless services at Google. The company has been raising money since it opened its doors in 2023 and reportedly hopes to deploy its first satellite by 2027. Logos’ planned low Earth orbit constellation would beam high-speed broadband internet to customers worldwide, including government and enterprise users, much like Starlink.\n\nWhile the satellite broadband market is growing, Starlink remains the biggest player by far. The European Space Agency estimates there are just over 14,000 functioning satellites currently in orbit and we know that roughly 9,600 of them are a part of the Starlink constellation. The SpaceX subsidiary recently asked the FCC for clearance to launch a million satellites, though in reality, the FCC will likely trend closer to the 7,500 it approved on the last go-around. The ESA says it expects 100,000 satellites to be in orbit by 2030.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-potential-starlink-competitor-just-got-fcc-clearance-to-launch-4000-satellites-143905076.html?src=rss",

The Information reports that in December, Nvidia managers decided not to release the new cards as scheduled, choosing to prioritize AI chips instead due to the limited supply of RAM currently available. On top of that, \"Nvidia is also slashing production of its current line of gaming chips,\" the RTX 50-series, which are already in high demand and consistently sold out at retailers. \nThe priority shift away from gaming GPUs follows record-breaking revenue for Nvidia, driven by its AI chips.

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/ai-for-transformation-how-saps-joule-for-consultants-reimagines-project",
        "description": "Presented by SAP\n\nSAP’s AI solution, Joule, has already transformed how business users work — turning siloed data and tasks into intelligent, connected workflows. But consultants on SAP projects face a different set of needs: navigating complex implementations, evolving best practices, and the pressure to deliver faster. They need timely, expert-level guidance. They need an AI partner that can deliver accurate SAP knowledge in an instant. Enter SAP Joule for Consultants, purpose-built to help system integrators and consulting teams drive smarter, faster outcomes for their clients.\n\"The consultant's focus is not using our business applications — it’s to help implement those systems, perform upgrades, and at the largest scale, help our customers transform their on-premises SAP ERP to SAP Business Suite in the cloud,\" says Victor Alvarez, head of product marketing, Joule, at SAP. \"Acting as a knowledge-grounded AI teammate, SAP Joule for Consultants delivers trusted answers at critical moments, guides design decisions, and keeps projects aligned with SAP’s latest best practices.\"\nIt can both compress timelines and improve project execution at every stage of delivery, resulting in a higher quality of service, he adds. \n\"Our customers want to complete their SAP projects as quickly as possible to realize the value of those initiatives sooner,\" Alvarez says. \"SAP Joule for Consultants puts the most accurate and up-to-date information at the fingertips of the consultants and system integrators performing these projects. It helps consultants decide and act with agility, reduce overall costs, and shorten project timelines without sacrificing quality.\"\nBuilding a better AI teammate\nAI is no longer an option in consulting. It’s reshaping how projects are designed, delivered, and scaled. For SAP consulting practices, this shift is especially pronounced as SAP cloud transformation and implementation projects demand deep knowledge and expertise. AI can help surface knowledge in seconds, making consultants more productive and improving project outcomes. As a result, practice leaders are not considering whether to use AI, but which AI solution to put at the core of their delivery model.\nWhat sets SAP Joule for Consultants apart is its underlying knowledge base. Any AI solution can generate an answer. What matters most is if the answer is accurate and can be trusted to guide project execution. SAP Joule for Consultants is grounded in SAP’s most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date knowledge base. The knowledge base is expertly curated by SAP and includes exclusive content not available to third-party solutions or AI-enabled search engines. \n“We recognized an opportunity to help our partners transform their consulting practices with the most reliable AI assistance available,” Alvarez says. “We’ve leveraged our expertise and vast set of non-public customer enablement content to ground SAP Joule for Consultants with the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy knowledge.” \nFor SAP consultants at every level \nConsultants at all experience levels have traditionally spent enormous time searching for information before they can take the next step — whether it’s making an architectural decision that shapes an entire implementation or solving a specific, tactical issue.\nAll that research time is slashed to an extraordinary degree with SAP Joule for Consultants. By delivering expert-level answers drawn from a continually updated knowledge base, the solution helps consultants keep work moving and make smarter decisions that minimize rework.\n\"If you think about cloud transformation, there’s a huge return on investment,” Alvarez explains. “For SAP customers, this ROI goes beyond traditional cloud benefits to also unlock the AI innovations available in SAP Business Suite. SAP Joule for Consultants is part of our commitment to help our customers reduce time to value and achieve AI impact at scale.\"\nEnabling SAP customers too\nThe solution isn't just for consultants; it’s also for the IT departments within SAP customers. Organizations don’t have the luxury of engaging a consultant for every SAP project — sometimes the work needs to, or can be, done in-house. So, in the same way that SAP Joule for Consultants enables consultants with expert-level knowledge, internal IT teams can benefit from on-demand answers and guidance to accelerate internally staffed projects. \n\"They can use SAP Joule for Consultants to access the knowledge needed to take on more complex projects too,\" Alvarez says. \"That opens up more opportunity to engage system integrators on the more strategic and impactful projects.”\nIT teams also benefit from elevated collaboration with their consulting partners. SAP Joule for Consultants helps bridge knowledge gaps that traditionally limit how much internal staff can contribute to and influence project outcomes.\n\"SAP Joule for Consultants makes customers more informed, so that they can collaborate with their consultant partners in a more impactful way,\" he explains. \"It illuminates the nuances of a project, helping clients ask the right questions and participate more actively in critical project decisions to ensure the best possible project outcomes.\"\nPowerful new features coming soon\nSAP Joule for Consultants has been generally available for almost one year, and the demand from both large firms like KPMG and smaller organizations has been tremendous, Alvarez says — a strong validation of its value proposition. The next major milestone is already on the horizon: partner knowledge integration.\n“Our system integrator partners have institutional knowledge that embodies their industry experience and the best practices that distinguish their services and create predictable project outcomes,” he explains. “Soon, they’ll be able to add that institutional knowledge to their instance of SAP Joule for Consultants — creating a single, unified solution that puts both SAP and firm-specific knowledge at their consultants’ fingertips.”\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

        "description": "You will have to wait a bit longer before you can buy a Steam Machine — and you may have to pay more for one, too. Valve had intended to release the console-style SteamOS-powered device in early 2026, and AMD CEO Lisa Su just claimed that the company was on track to start shipping it soon. But in a new post detailing the latest updates for its upcoming Steam products, Valve has revealed that while it’s still aiming to start selling the console in the first half of the year, it has yet to decide on concrete pricing and a launch date for it. The release of Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset and controller will be delayed, as well.\nValve was hoping to be able to announce pricing and launch dates by now. The company cited industry-wide memory and storage shortages, which have grown since the Steam devices’ announcement, as the culprit for the delay. It explained that it has to rethink their exact shipping schedules and pricing due to the limited availability and the rising prices of those components. “We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible,” Valve wrote. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the artificial intelligence industry has been hoovering up manufacturers’ available memory chips and hard drives for its infrastructure developments. That has led to shortages for other industries, like PCs and phones. \nThe Steam Machine is a compact cube-like PC for gaming powered by a semi-custom AMD CPU and GPU. Valve said during its announcement that it has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. In the new post, Valve said that majority of Steam titles played great at those settings during testing, though some required more upscaling than others and may fare better when played at a lower framerate to maintain a 1080p resolution. It also revealed that you will have easy access to the Machine’s SSD and memory if you want to upgrade them. Meanwhile, the Steam Frame is a wireless, standalone VR headset that can play both PC and Android games. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html?src=rss",

        "description": "You might have noticed that over the last several years, more and more companies have shifted to a subscription model for their products and services, and Apple has slowly begun to follow suit. As Apple hardware continues to improve, customers are keeping their devices for longer. Meaning that Apple is earning less per customer on their hardware purchases. This has pushed Apple to add more products to its services. Today, Apple offers subscriptions like cloud storage, media, productivity tools, AppleCare, and now products like Creator Studio. This suggests the company is willing to expand subscriptions into areas that were traditionally one-time purchases, a trend that we need to keep a close eye on. The easiest way to see how far Apple has leaned into subscriptions is to simply lay out everything the company currently offers.\nmore…",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/",
        "description": "Japanese blog Mac Otakara today shared some alleged details about the iPhone 17e and iPad 12, which are both expected to be released within the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 2025, Apple discontinued the iPhone SE and released a new entry-level iPhone 16e. The device features a 6.1-inch OLED display, an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, an Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The iPhone 17e would be the follow-up, spec-bumped model.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, which cites \"reliable sources,\" the iPhone 17e will have a similar overall design as the iPhone 16e. While some previous rumors indicated that the iPhone 17e would have a Dynamic Island, the report said this information is not true and that the device will continue to have a notch like the iPhone 16e.\r\n\r\nA19 chip: This one is no big surprise, but the iPhone 17e is expected to be powered by Apple's A19 chip, up from the A18 chip in the iPhone 16e. This upgrade will result in faster performance and power efficiency improvements.\n\r\n  \nC1X modem: Apple says its second-generation C1X modem for 5G and LTE is up to twice as fast as its first-generation C1 modem in the iPhone 16e. Apple also says the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone to date.\n\r\nN1 chip: Like the iPhone Air, the report said the iPhone 17e will be equipped with Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. In the iPhone Air, the N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and Apple says the chip improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.\nAs for the iPad 12, the report said that device will likely have a similar design as the iPad 11, but with a newer A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence. That means the iPad 12 would have 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPad 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate report from Macwelt, available in English on Macworld, cites a source who said that Apple plans to announce the iPhone 17e with a press release on an unusual date: Thursday, February 19. The publication agreed that the iPhone 17e will not have a Dynamic Island, but they do expect the device to feature MagSafe, as previously rumored.\n\r\n  \nMagSafe: Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 17e will reportedly feature MagSafe for up to 20W-25W magnetic wireless charging. The iPhone 16e is limited to Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W speeds. You would also be able to magnetically attach accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wallet to the back of the iPhone 17e.\nMacwelt added that the iPhone 17e will still have a single rear camera.\r\n\r\nApple announced the iPhone 16e on Wednesday, February 19 last year, so the iPhone 17e would be unveiled exactly one year later if this rumor is accurate. It is quite uncommon for Apple to unveil new products on a Thursday, but anything is possible.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundup: iPad\nTags: Mac Otakara, Macwelt, Macworld\nBuyer's Guide: iPad (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"iPhone 17e and iPad 12 Features and Release Date Rumors Surface in Two New Reports\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/mistral-drops-voxtral-transcribe-2-an-open-source-speech-model-that-runs-on",
        "description": "Mistral AI, the Paris-based startup positioning itself as Europe's answer to OpenAI, released a pair of speech-to-text models on Wednesday that the company says can transcribe audio faster, more accurately, and far more cheaply than anything else on the market — all while running entirely on a smartphone or laptop.\nThe announcement marks the latest salvo in an increasingly competitive battle over voice AI, a technology that enterprise customers see as essential for everything from automated customer service to real-time translation. But unlike offerings from American tech giants, Mistral's new Voxtral Transcribe 2 models are designed to process sensitive audio without ever transmitting it to remote servers — a feature that could prove decisive for companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and defense.\n\"You'd like your voice and the transcription of your voice to stay close to where you are, meaning you want it to happen on device—on a laptop, a phone, or a smartwatch,\" Pierre Stock, Mistral's vice president of science operations, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"We make that possible because the model is only 4 billion parameters. It's small enough to fit almost anywhere.\"\nMistral splits its new AI transcription technology into batch processing and real-time applications\nMistral released two distinct models under the Voxtral Transcribe 2 banner, each engineered for different use cases.\n\nVoxtral Mini Transcribe V2 handles batch transcription, processing pre-recorded audio files in bulk. The company says it achieves the lowest word error rate of any transcription service and is available via API at $0.003 per minute, roughly one-fifth the price of major competitors. The model supports 13 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and several European languages.\n\nVoxtral Realtime, as its name suggests, processes live audio with a latency that can be configured down to 200 milliseconds — the blink of an eye. Mistral claims this is a breakthrough for applications where even a two-second delay proves unacceptable: live subtitling, voice agents, and real-time customer service augmentation.\n\nThe Realtime model ships under an Apache 2.0 open-source license, meaning developers can download the model weights from Hugging Face, modify them, and deploy them without paying Mistral a licensing fee. For companies that prefer not to run their own infrastructure, API access costs $0.006 per minute.\nStock said Mistral is betting on the open-source community to expand the model's reach. \"The open-source community is very imaginative when it comes to applications,\" he said. \"We're excited to see what they're going to do.\"\nWhy on-device AI processing matters for enterprises handling sensitive data\nThe decision to engineer models small enough to run locally reflects a calculation about where the enterprise market is heading. As companies integrate AI into ever more sensitive workflows — transcribing medical consultations, financial advisory calls, legal depositions — the question of where that data travels has become a dealbreaker.\nStock painted a vivid picture of the problem during his interview. Current note-taking applications with audio capabilities, he explained, often pick up ambient noise in problematic ways: \"It might pick up the lyrics of the music in the background. It might pick up another conversation. It might hallucinate from a background noise.\"\nMistral invested heavily in training data curation and model architecture to address these issues. \"All of that, we spend a lot of time ironing out the data and the way we train the model to robustify it,\" Stock said.\nThe company also added enterprise-specific features that its American competitors have been slower to implement. Context biasing allows customers to upload a list of specialized terminology — medical jargon, proprietary product names, industry acronyms — and the model will automatically favor those terms when transcribing ambiguous audio. Unlike fine-tuning, which requires retraining the model, context biasing works through a simple API parameter.\n\"You only need a text list,\" Stock explained. \"And then the model will automatically bias the transcription toward these acronyms or these weird words. And it's zero shots, no need for retraining, no need for weird stuff.\"\nFrom factory floors to call centers, Mistral targets high-noise industrial environments\nStock described two scenarios that capture how Mistral envisions the technology being deployed.\nThe first involves industrial auditing. Imagine technicians walking through a manufacturing facility, inspecting heavy machinery while shouting observations over the din of factory noise. \"In the end, imagine like a perfect timestamped notes identifying who said what — so diarization — while being super robust,\" Stock said. The challenge is handling what he called \"weird technical language that no one is able to spell except these people.\"\nThe second scenario targets customer service operations. When a caller contacts a support center, Voxtral Realtime can transcribe the conversation in real time, feeding text to backend systems that pull up relevant customer records before the caller finishes explaining the problem.\n\"The status will appear for the operator on the screen before the customer stops the sentence and stops complaining,\" Stock explained. \"Which means you can just interact and say, 'Okay, I can see the status. Let me correct the address and send back the shipment.'\"\nHe estimated this could reduce typical customer service interactions from multiple back-and-forth exchanges to just two interactions: the customer explains the problem, and the agent resolves it immediately.\nReal-time translation across languages could arrive by the end of 2026\nFor all the focus on transcription, Stock made clear that Mistral views these models as foundational technology for a more ambitious goal: real-time speech-to-speech translation that feels natural.\n\"Maybe the end goal application and what the model is laying the groundwork for is live translation,\" he said. \"I speak French, you speak English. It's key to have minimal latency, because otherwise you don't build empathy. Your face is not out of sync with what you said one second ago.\"\nThat goal puts Mistral in direct competition with Apple and Google, both of which have been racing to solve the same problem. Google's latest translation model operates at a two-second delay — ten times slower than what Mistral claims for Voxtral Realtime.\nMistral positions itself as the privacy-first alternative for enterprise customers\nMistral occupies an unusual position in the AI landscape. Founded in 2023 by alumni of Meta and Google DeepMind, the company has raised over $2 billion and now carries a valuation of approximately $13.6 billion. Yet it operates with a fraction of the compute resources available to American hyperscalers — and has built its strategy around efficiency rather than brute force.\n\"The models we release are enterprise grade, industry leading, efficient — in particular, in terms of cost — can be embedded into the edge, unlocks privacy, unlocks control, transparency,\" Stock said.\nThat approach has resonated particularly with European customers wary of dependence on American technology. In January, France's Ministry of the Armed Forces signed a framework agreement giving the country's military access to Mistral's AI models—a deal that explicitly requires deployment on French-controlled infrastructure.\nData privacy remains one of the biggest barriers to voice AI adoption in the enterprise. For companies in sensitive industries — finance, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance — sending audio data to external cloud servers is often a non-starter. The information needs to stay either on the device itself or within the company's own infrastructure.\nMistral faces stiff competition from OpenAI, Google, and a rising China\nThe transcription market has grown fiercely competitive. OpenAI's Whisper model has become something of an industry standard, available both through API and as downloadable open-source weights. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all offer enterprise-grade speech services. Specialized players like Assembly AI and Deepgram have built substantial businesses serving developers who need reliable, scalable transcription.\nMistral claims its new models outperform all of them on accuracy benchmarks while undercutting them on price. \"We are better than them on the benchmarks,\" Stock said. Independent verification of those claims will take time, but the company points to performance on FLEURS, a widely used multilingual speech benchmark, where Voxtral models achieve word error rates competitive with or superior to alternatives from OpenAI and Google.\nPerhaps more significantly, Mistral's CEO Arthur Mensch has warned that American AI companies face pressure from an unexpected direction. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mensch dismissed the notion that Chinese AI lags behind the West as \"a fairy tale.\"\n\"The capabilities of China's open-source technology is probably stressing the CEOs in the US,\" he said.\nThe French startup bets that trust will determine the winner in enterprise voice AI\nStock predicted that 2026 would be \"the year of note-taking\" — the moment when AI transcription becomes reliable enough that users trust it completely.\n\"You need to trust the model, and the model basically cannot make any mistake, otherwise you would just lose trust in the product and stop using it,\" he said. \"The threshold is super, super hard.\"\nWhether Mistral has crossed that threshold remains to be seen. Enterprise customers will be the ultimate judges, and they tend to move slowly, testing claims against reality before committing budgets and workflows to new technology. The audio playground in Mistral Studio, where developers can test Voxtral Transcribe 2 with their own files, went live today.\nBut Stock's broader argument deserves attention. In a market where American giants compete by throwing billions of dollars at ever-larger models, Mistral is making a different wager: that in the age of AI, smaller and local might beat bigger and distant. For the executives who spend their days worrying about data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and vendor lock-in, that pitch may prove more compelling than any benchmark.\nThe race to dominate enterprise voice AI is no longer just about who builds the most powerful model. It's about who builds the model you're willing to let listen.",

        "description": "The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, has prohibited Amazon from continuing its practice of using mechanisms to control the prices charged by sellers on its platform in the country. Germany’s competition regulator explained that the company uses “various price control mechanisms” to review prices set by third-party Markerplace sellers. If the website deems a specific listing’s pricing as too high, it allegedly removes the listing altogether or prevents it from being prominently displayed in the Buy Box section that lets you quickly purchase items. If those listings aren’t removed completely, they’re banished to less prominent sections like in the “See all buying options” and the “Other sellers on Amazon” lists. This reduced visibility could “lead to significant losses in sales” for sellers. \nAmazon was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, because the company itself runs its own retail business and sells goods on the platform. That makes third-party sellers, which make up for 60 percent of the items sold on the website, direct competitors. Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said Amazon must only be allowed to influence competitors’ pricing “in the most exceptional cases,” such as “in the event of excessive pricing.” He didn’t specify what the agency views as “excessive pricing,” but he said allowing the company to continue its current practices will give it the power to “control the price level on the trading platform according to its own ideas.” He also said that Amazon could use its mechanisms “to compete with the rest of the online retail sector outside”of its own website. Amazon’s interference could lead to third-party sellers “no longer being able to cover their own costs, forcing them out of the Marketplace,” he added. \nRocco Bräuniger, Amazon’s country manager for Germany, told Bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling and will continue operating as usual. “Amazon would be the only retailer in Germany forced to highlight non-competitive prices for customers,” he said. ”This makes no sense for customers, sales partners, or competition.” He also asserted that the office’s decision will throttle innovation in the European Union. \nAmazon has been under scrutiny in Europe for years now. Back in 2022, it pledged not to use private sellers’ data to compete with them in the Marketplace in the EU. It also promised to give sellers \"equal treatment” when ranking them in the Buy Box section. \n“The Bundeskartellamt considers this systematic interference in the Marketplace sellers’ freedom to set their own prices to constitute an abuse under the special provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) as well as a violation of the general abuse provisions under Section 19 GWB and Article 102 TFEU,” the agency wrote. “…In these proceedings, the Bundeskartellamt has worked closely with the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act).”\nThe agency is slapping Amazon with a fine due to those violations, but the $70 million penalty it’s asking for is merely partial payment based on the economic benefits the company enjoyed from its alleged anti-competitive behaviors. According to the Bundeskartellamt, the identified antitrust violations are still ongoing, so Amazon may have to pay more. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-germany-fined-70-million-for-influencing-third-party-marketplace-pricing-140000588.html?src=rss",
