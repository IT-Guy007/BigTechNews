On Wednesday, Anthropic said free Claude users can now create files, connect to external services, use skills and more.\nAnthropic added the ability for paid users to create files in September. Starting today, free users of the chatbot can also create and edit Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Word docs and PDFs. Claude's file creation abilities are powered by Sonnet 4.5.\nFree users can now create and edit Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Word docs, and PDFs.\nAnthropic\n\nMeanwhile, Connectors allow free users to link Claude to third-party services. There's a long list of available ones, including Canva, Slack, Notion, Zapier and PayPal.\nSkills, on the other hand, let you teach Claude to \"complete specific tasks in repeatable ways.\" In short, the chatbot loads folders of instructions, scripts and other resources when performing relevant tasks. Other upgrades to the free tier include longer conversations, interactive responses and improved voice and image search.\nClaude's free-tier upgrades appear to be a direct response to ChatGPT's planned introduction of ads for its free users. Anthropic's announcement today ended with the tag line, \"No ads in sight.\" This follows the company's promise last week that Claude will remain ad-free. Anthropic even poked fun at OpenAI's cash-seeking move in a Super Bowl ad (below), which also took a swipe at GPT-4o's penchant for kissing ass.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-beefs-up-claudes-free-tier-as-openai-prepares-to-stuff-ads-into-chatgpts-194100939.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Anthropic’s Claude Cowork finally lands on Windows — and it wants to automate your workday",
      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-cowork-finally-lands-on-windows-and-it-wants-to-automate",
      "description": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.\nThe Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\n\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We're bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"\nThe release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple's operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic's competing tools internally.\n\nInside Microsoft's surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rival\nThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.\nBut the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.\nMicrosoft's CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\n\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.\nThe company's spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.\nA $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its bets\nMicrosoft's embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft's products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI's technology.\nThat relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic's Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic's models have proven more capable than OpenAI's counterparts.\nOn February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic's most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company's enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\n\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"\nThe timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.\nWhy a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its future\nThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork's capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.\nBloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.\nThe fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user's machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.\nAnthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company's Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.\nThe hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your files\nSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company's support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.\nCowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\n\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don't give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"\nThe Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user's personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\n\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.\nMajor corporations are already betting on Claude's enterprise potential\nDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest. Customer testimonials published alongside the Claude Opus 4.6 announcement on the Microsoft Azure blog included statements from Adobe, Dentons, and other major organizations already integrating Anthropic's technology into their workflows.\n\"At Adobe, we're continuously evaluating new AI capabilities that can help us deliver more powerful, responsible, and intuitive experiences for our customers,\" said Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer. \"Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\"\nMatej Jambrich, CTO of Dentons Europe, described deploying Claude for legal work: \"Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.\"\nOn Reddit, an Anthropic representative wrote that the Windows release addresses \"the most consistent request\" since Cowork's macOS debut — a demand that came \"especially from enterprise teams.\" The detail underscores the tool's perceived value in corporate environments where Windows dominates the desktop landscape.\nAt $20 a month, Cowork positions itself as a premium productivity play\nAccess to these capabilities comes at a price. Cowork for Windows is available in research preview at claude.com/cowork for all paid Claude subscription tiers, including Pro ($20/month), Max ($100/month), Team, and Enterprise. Free-tier users cannot access the feature.\nThis pricing structure positions Cowork as a premium productivity tool rather than a mass-market offering — at least for now. Anthropic has not announced plans for broader availability, and the \"research preview\" designation suggests the company continues to gather user feedback before committing to a general release.\nThe January macOS launch was similarly restricted to $100/month Max subscribers before expanding to other paid tiers, suggesting Anthropic may follow a gradual rollout strategy as it refines the product. For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.\nThe battle for the future of work has a new front line\nFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.\nThe company's willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.\nFor the broader software industry, Cowork's expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.\nThe $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork's January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.\nThe software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openai-deploys-cerebras-chips-for-15x-faster-code-generation-in-first-major",
      "description": "OpenAI on Thursday launched GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a stripped-down coding model engineered for near-instantaneous response times, marking the company's first significant inference partnership outside its traditional Nvidia-dominated infrastructure. The model runs on hardware from Cerebras Systems, a Sunnyvale-based chipmaker whose wafer-scale processors specialize in low-latency AI workloads.\nThe partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. The company finds itself navigating a frayed relationship with longtime chip supplier Nvidia, mounting criticism over its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT, a newly announced Pentagon contract, and internal organizational upheaval that has seen a safety-focused team disbanded and at least one researcher resign in protest.\n\"GPUs remain foundational across our training and inference pipelines and deliver the most cost effective tokens for broad usage,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"Cerebras complements that foundation by excelling at workflows that demand extremely low latency, tightening the end-to-end loop so use cases such as real-time coding in Codex feel more responsive as you iterate.\"\nThe careful framing — emphasizing that GPUs \"remain foundational\" while positioning Cerebras as a \"complement\" — underscores the delicate balance OpenAI must strike as it diversifies its chip suppliers without alienating Nvidia, the dominant force in AI accelerators.\nSpeed gains come with capability tradeoffs that OpenAI says developers will accept\nCodex-Spark represents OpenAI's first model purpose-built for real-time coding collaboration. The company claims the model delivers more than 1000 tokens per second when served on ultra-low latency hardware, though it declined to provide specific latency metrics such as time-to-first-token figures.\n\"We aren't able to share specific latency numbers, however Codex-Spark is optimized to feel near-instant — delivering more than 1000 tokens per second while remaining highly capable for real-world coding tasks,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said.\nThe speed gains come with acknowledged capability tradeoffs. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 — two industry benchmarks that evaluate AI systems' ability to perform complex software engineering tasks autonomously — Codex-Spark underperforms the full GPT-5.3-Codex model. OpenAI positions this as an acceptable exchange: developers get responses fast enough to maintain creative flow, even if the underlying model cannot tackle the most sophisticated multi-step programming challenges.\nThe model launches with a 128,000-token context window and supports text only — no image or multimodal inputs. OpenAI has made it available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro subscribers through the Codex app, command-line interface, and Visual Studio Code extension. A small group of enterprise partners will receive API access to evaluate integration possibilities.\n\"We are making Codex-Spark available in the API for a small set of design partners to understand how developers want to integrate Codex-Spark into their products,\" the spokesperson explained. \"We'll expand access over the coming weeks as we continue tuning our integration under real workloads.\"\nCerebras hardware eliminates bottlenecks that plague traditional GPU clusters\nThe technical architecture behind Codex-Spark tells a story about inference economics that increasingly matters as AI companies scale consumer-facing products. Cerebras's Wafer Scale Engine 3 — a single chip roughly the size of a dinner plate containing 4 trillion transistors — eliminates much of the communication overhead that occurs when AI workloads spread across clusters of smaller processors.\nFor training massive models, that distributed approach remains necessary and Nvidia's GPUs excel at it. But for inference — the process of generating responses to user queries — Cerebras argues its architecture can deliver results with dramatically lower latency. Sean Lie, Cerebras's CTO and co-founder, framed the partnership as an opportunity to reshape how developers interact with AI systems.\n\"What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,\" Lie said in a statement. \"This preview is just the beginning.\"\nOpenAI's infrastructure team did not limit its optimization work to the Cerebras hardware. The company announced latency improvements across its entire inference stack that benefit all Codex models regardless of underlying hardware, including persistent WebSocket connections and optimizations within the Responses API. The results: 80 percent reduction in overhead per client-server round trip, 30 percent reduction in per-token overhead, and 50 percent reduction in time-to-first-token.\nA $100 billion Nvidia megadeal has quietly fallen apart behind the scenes\nThe Cerebras partnership takes on additional significance given the increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. Last fall, when OpenAI announced its Stargate infrastructure initiative, Nvidia publicly committed to investing $100 billion to support OpenAI as it built out AI infrastructure. The announcement appeared to cement a strategic alliance between the world's most valuable AI company and its dominant chip supplier.\nFive months later, that megadeal has effectively stalled, according to multiple reports. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly denied tensions, telling reporters in late January that there is \"no drama\" and that Nvidia remains committed to participating in OpenAI's current funding round. But the relationship has cooled considerably, with friction stemming from multiple sources.\nOpenAI has aggressively pursued partnerships with alternative chip suppliers, including the Cerebras deal and separate agreements with AMD and Broadcom. From Nvidia's perspective, OpenAI may be using its influence to commoditize the very hardware that made its AI breakthroughs possible. From OpenAI's perspective, reducing dependence on a single supplier represents prudent business strategy.\n\"We will continue working with the ecosystem on evaluating the most price-performant chips across all use cases on an ongoing basis,\" OpenAI's spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"GPUs remain our priority for cost-sensitive and throughput-first use cases across research and inference.\" The statement reads as a careful effort to avoid antagonizing Nvidia while preserving flexibility — and reflects a broader reality that training frontier AI models still requires exactly the kind of massive parallel processing that Nvidia GPUs provide.\nDisbanded safety teams and researcher departures raise questions about OpenAI's priorities\nThe Codex-Spark launch comes as OpenAI navigates a series of internal challenges that have intensified scrutiny of the company's direction and values. Earlier this week, reports emerged that OpenAI disbanded its mission alignment team, a group established in September 2024 to promote the company's stated goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The team's seven members have been reassigned to other roles, with leader Joshua Achiam given a new title as OpenAI's \"chief futurist.\"\nOpenAI previously disbanded another safety-focused group, the superalignment team, in 2024. That team had concentrated on long-term existential risks from AI. The pattern of dissolving safety-oriented teams has drawn criticism from researchers who argue that OpenAI's commercial pressures are overwhelming its original non-profit mission.\nThe company also faces fallout from its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT. Researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned this week over what she described as the \"slippery slope\" of ad-supported AI, warning in a New York Times essay that ChatGPT's archive of intimate user conversations creates unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Anthropic seized on the controversy with a Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nSeparately, the company agreed to provide ChatGPT to the Pentagon through Genai.mil, a new Department of Defense program that requires OpenAI to permit \"all lawful uses\" without company-imposed restrictions — terms that Anthropic reportedly rejected. And reports emerged that Ryan Beiermeister, OpenAI's vice president of product policy who had expressed concerns about a planned explicit content feature, was terminated in January following a discrimination allegation she denies.\nOpenAI envisions AI coding assistants that juggle quick edits and complex autonomous tasks\nDespite the surrounding turbulence, OpenAI's technical roadmap for Codex suggests ambitious plans. The company envisions a coding assistant that seamlessly blends rapid-fire interactive editing with longer-running autonomous tasks — an AI that handles quick fixes while simultaneously orchestrating multiple agents working on more complex problems in the background.\n\"Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background, or fanning out tasks to many models in parallel when you want breadth and speed, so you don't have to choose a single mode up front,\" the OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat.\nThis vision would require not just faster inference but sophisticated task decomposition and coordination across models of varying sizes and capabilities. Codex-Spark establishes the low-latency foundation for the interactive portion of that experience; future releases will need to deliver the autonomous reasoning and multi-agent coordination that would make the full vision possible.\nFor now, Codex-Spark operates under separate rate limits from other OpenAI models, reflecting constrained Cerebras infrastructure capacity during the research preview. \"Because it runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate rate limit that may adjust based on demand during the research preview,\" the spokesperson noted. The limits are designed to be \"generous,\" with OpenAI monitoring usage patterns as it determines how to scale.\nThe real test is whether faster responses translate into better software\nThe Codex-Spark announcement arrives amid intense competition for AI-powered developer tools. Anthropic's Claude Cowork product triggered a selloff in traditional software stocks last week as investors considered whether AI assistants might displace conventional enterprise applications. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue investing heavily in AI coding capabilities integrated with their respective cloud platforms.\nOpenAI's Codex app has demonstrated rapid adoption since launching ten days ago, with more than one million downloads and weekly active users growing 60 percent week-over-week. More than 325,000 developers now actively use Codex across free and paid tiers. But the fundamental question facing OpenAI — and the broader AI industry — is whether speed improvements like those promised by Codex-Spark translate into meaningful productivity gains or merely create more pleasant experiences without changing outcomes.\nEarly evidence from AI coding tools suggests that faster responses encourage more iterative experimentation. Whether that experimentation produces better software remains contested among researchers and practitioners alike. What seems clear is that OpenAI views inference latency as a competitive frontier worth substantial investment, even as that investment takes it beyond its traditional Nvidia partnership into untested territory with alternative chip suppliers.\nThe Cerebras deal is a calculated bet that specialized hardware can unlock use cases that general-purpose GPUs cannot cost-effectively serve. For a company simultaneously battling competitors, managing strained supplier relationships, and weathering internal dissent over its commercial direction, it is also a reminder that in the AI race, standing still is not an option. OpenAI built its reputation by moving fast and breaking conventions. Now it must prove it can move even faster — without breaking itself.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-cowork-finally-lands-on-windows-and-it-wants-to-automate",
        "description": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.\nThe Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\n\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We're bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"\nThe release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple's operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic's competing tools internally.\n\nInside Microsoft's surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rival\nThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.\nBut the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.\nMicrosoft's CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\n\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.\nThe company's spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.\nA $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its bets\nMicrosoft's embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft's products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI's technology.\nThat relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic's Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic's models have proven more capable than OpenAI's counterparts.\nOn February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic's most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company's enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\n\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"\nThe timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.\nWhy a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its future\nThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork's capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.\nBloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.\nThe fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user's machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.\nAnthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company's Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.\nThe hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your files\nSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company's support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.\nCowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\n\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don't give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"\nThe Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user's personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\n\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.\nMajor corporations are already betting on Claude's enterprise potential\nDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest. Customer testimonials published alongside the Claude Opus 4.6 announcement on the Microsoft Azure blog included statements from Adobe, Dentons, and other major organizations already integrating Anthropic's technology into their workflows.\n\"At Adobe, we're continuously evaluating new AI capabilities that can help us deliver more powerful, responsible, and intuitive experiences for our customers,\" said Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer. \"Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\"\nMatej Jambrich, CTO of Dentons Europe, described deploying Claude for legal work: \"Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.\"\nOn Reddit, an Anthropic representative wrote that the Windows release addresses \"the most consistent request\" since Cowork's macOS debut — a demand that came \"especially from enterprise teams.\" The detail underscores the tool's perceived value in corporate environments where Windows dominates the desktop landscape.\nAt $20 a month, Cowork positions itself as a premium productivity play\nAccess to these capabilities comes at a price. Cowork for Windows is available in research preview at claude.com/cowork for all paid Claude subscription tiers, including Pro ($20/month), Max ($100/month), Team, and Enterprise. Free-tier users cannot access the feature.\nThis pricing structure positions Cowork as a premium productivity tool rather than a mass-market offering — at least for now. Anthropic has not announced plans for broader availability, and the \"research preview\" designation suggests the company continues to gather user feedback before committing to a general release.\nThe January macOS launch was similarly restricted to $100/month Max subscribers before expanding to other paid tiers, suggesting Anthropic may follow a gradual rollout strategy as it refines the product. For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.\nThe battle for the future of work has a new front line\nFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.\nThe company's willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.\nFor the broader software industry, Cowork's expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.\nThe $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork's January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.\nThe software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openai-deploys-cerebras-chips-for-15x-faster-code-generation-in-first-major",
        "description": "OpenAI on Thursday launched GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a stripped-down coding model engineered for near-instantaneous response times, marking the company's first significant inference partnership outside its traditional Nvidia-dominated infrastructure. The model runs on hardware from Cerebras Systems, a Sunnyvale-based chipmaker whose wafer-scale processors specialize in low-latency AI workloads.\nThe partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. The company finds itself navigating a frayed relationship with longtime chip supplier Nvidia, mounting criticism over its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT, a newly announced Pentagon contract, and internal organizational upheaval that has seen a safety-focused team disbanded and at least one researcher resign in protest.\n\"GPUs remain foundational across our training and inference pipelines and deliver the most cost effective tokens for broad usage,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"Cerebras complements that foundation by excelling at workflows that demand extremely low latency, tightening the end-to-end loop so use cases such as real-time coding in Codex feel more responsive as you iterate.\"\nThe careful framing — emphasizing that GPUs \"remain foundational\" while positioning Cerebras as a \"complement\" — underscores the delicate balance OpenAI must strike as it diversifies its chip suppliers without alienating Nvidia, the dominant force in AI accelerators.\nSpeed gains come with capability tradeoffs that OpenAI says developers will accept\nCodex-Spark represents OpenAI's first model purpose-built for real-time coding collaboration. The company claims the model delivers more than 1000 tokens per second when served on ultra-low latency hardware, though it declined to provide specific latency metrics such as time-to-first-token figures.\n\"We aren't able to share specific latency numbers, however Codex-Spark is optimized to feel near-instant — delivering more than 1000 tokens per second while remaining highly capable for real-world coding tasks,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said.\nThe speed gains come with acknowledged capability tradeoffs. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 — two industry benchmarks that evaluate AI systems' ability to perform complex software engineering tasks autonomously — Codex-Spark underperforms the full GPT-5.3-Codex model. OpenAI positions this as an acceptable exchange: developers get responses fast enough to maintain creative flow, even if the underlying model cannot tackle the most sophisticated multi-step programming challenges.\nThe model launches with a 128,000-token context window and supports text only — no image or multimodal inputs. OpenAI has made it available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro subscribers through the Codex app, command-line interface, and Visual Studio Code extension. A small group of enterprise partners will receive API access to evaluate integration possibilities.\n\"We are making Codex-Spark available in the API for a small set of design partners to understand how developers want to integrate Codex-Spark into their products,\" the spokesperson explained. \"We'll expand access over the coming weeks as we continue tuning our integration under real workloads.\"\nCerebras hardware eliminates bottlenecks that plague traditional GPU clusters\nThe technical architecture behind Codex-Spark tells a story about inference economics that increasingly matters as AI companies scale consumer-facing products. Cerebras's Wafer Scale Engine 3 — a single chip roughly the size of a dinner plate containing 4 trillion transistors — eliminates much of the communication overhead that occurs when AI workloads spread across clusters of smaller processors.\nFor training massive models, that distributed approach remains necessary and Nvidia's GPUs excel at it. But for inference — the process of generating responses to user queries — Cerebras argues its architecture can deliver results with dramatically lower latency. Sean Lie, Cerebras's CTO and co-founder, framed the partnership as an opportunity to reshape how developers interact with AI systems.\n\"What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,\" Lie said in a statement. \"This preview is just the beginning.\"\nOpenAI's infrastructure team did not limit its optimization work to the Cerebras hardware. The company announced latency improvements across its entire inference stack that benefit all Codex models regardless of underlying hardware, including persistent WebSocket connections and optimizations within the Responses API. The results: 80 percent reduction in overhead per client-server round trip, 30 percent reduction in per-token overhead, and 50 percent reduction in time-to-first-token.\nA $100 billion Nvidia megadeal has quietly fallen apart behind the scenes\nThe Cerebras partnership takes on additional significance given the increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. Last fall, when OpenAI announced its Stargate infrastructure initiative, Nvidia publicly committed to investing $100 billion to support OpenAI as it built out AI infrastructure. The announcement appeared to cement a strategic alliance between the world's most valuable AI company and its dominant chip supplier.\nFive months later, that megadeal has effectively stalled, according to multiple reports. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly denied tensions, telling reporters in late January that there is \"no drama\" and that Nvidia remains committed to participating in OpenAI's current funding round. But the relationship has cooled considerably, with friction stemming from multiple sources.\nOpenAI has aggressively pursued partnerships with alternative chip suppliers, including the Cerebras deal and separate agreements with AMD and Broadcom. From Nvidia's perspective, OpenAI may be using its influence to commoditize the very hardware that made its AI breakthroughs possible. From OpenAI's perspective, reducing dependence on a single supplier represents prudent business strategy.\n\"We will continue working with the ecosystem on evaluating the most price-performant chips across all use cases on an ongoing basis,\" OpenAI's spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"GPUs remain our priority for cost-sensitive and throughput-first use cases across research and inference.\" The statement reads as a careful effort to avoid antagonizing Nvidia while preserving flexibility — and reflects a broader reality that training frontier AI models still requires exactly the kind of massive parallel processing that Nvidia GPUs provide.\nDisbanded safety teams and researcher departures raise questions about OpenAI's priorities\nThe Codex-Spark launch comes as OpenAI navigates a series of internal challenges that have intensified scrutiny of the company's direction and values. Earlier this week, reports emerged that OpenAI disbanded its mission alignment team, a group established in September 2024 to promote the company's stated goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The team's seven members have been reassigned to other roles, with leader Joshua Achiam given a new title as OpenAI's \"chief futurist.\"\nOpenAI previously disbanded another safety-focused group, the superalignment team, in 2024. That team had concentrated on long-term existential risks from AI. The pattern of dissolving safety-oriented teams has drawn criticism from researchers who argue that OpenAI's commercial pressures are overwhelming its original non-profit mission.\nThe company also faces fallout from its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT. Researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned this week over what she described as the \"slippery slope\" of ad-supported AI, warning in a New York Times essay that ChatGPT's archive of intimate user conversations creates unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Anthropic seized on the controversy with a Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nSeparately, the company agreed to provide ChatGPT to the Pentagon through Genai.mil, a new Department of Defense program that requires OpenAI to permit \"all lawful uses\" without company-imposed restrictions — terms that Anthropic reportedly rejected. And reports emerged that Ryan Beiermeister, OpenAI's vice president of product policy who had expressed concerns about a planned explicit content feature, was terminated in January following a discrimination allegation she denies.\nOpenAI envisions AI coding assistants that juggle quick edits and complex autonomous tasks\nDespite the surrounding turbulence, OpenAI's technical roadmap for Codex suggests ambitious plans. The company envisions a coding assistant that seamlessly blends rapid-fire interactive editing with longer-running autonomous tasks — an AI that handles quick fixes while simultaneously orchestrating multiple agents working on more complex problems in the background.\n\"Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background, or fanning out tasks to many models in parallel when you want breadth and speed, so you don't have to choose a single mode up front,\" the OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat.\nThis vision would require not just faster inference but sophisticated task decomposition and coordination across models of varying sizes and capabilities. Codex-Spark establishes the low-latency foundation for the interactive portion of that experience; future releases will need to deliver the autonomous reasoning and multi-agent coordination that would make the full vision possible.\nFor now, Codex-Spark operates under separate rate limits from other OpenAI models, reflecting constrained Cerebras infrastructure capacity during the research preview. \"Because it runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate rate limit that may adjust based on demand during the research preview,\" the spokesperson noted. The limits are designed to be \"generous,\" with OpenAI monitoring usage patterns as it determines how to scale.\nThe real test is whether faster responses translate into better software\nThe Codex-Spark announcement arrives amid intense competition for AI-powered developer tools. Anthropic's Claude Cowork product triggered a selloff in traditional software stocks last week as investors considered whether AI assistants might displace conventional enterprise applications. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue investing heavily in AI coding capabilities integrated with their respective cloud platforms.\nOpenAI's Codex app has demonstrated rapid adoption since launching ten days ago, with more than one million downloads and weekly active users growing 60 percent week-over-week. More than 325,000 developers now actively use Codex across free and paid tiers. But the fundamental question facing OpenAI — and the broader AI industry — is whether speed improvements like those promised by Codex-Spark translate into meaningful productivity gains or merely create more pleasant experiences without changing outcomes.\nEarly evidence from AI coding tools suggests that faster responses encourage more iterative experimentation. Whether that experimentation produces better software remains contested among researchers and practitioners alike. What seems clear is that OpenAI views inference latency as a competitive frontier worth substantial investment, even as that investment takes it beyond its traditional Nvidia partnership into untested territory with alternative chip suppliers.\nThe Cerebras deal is a calculated bet that specialized hardware can unlock use cases that general-purpose GPUs cannot cost-effectively serve. For a company simultaneously battling competitors, managing strained supplier relationships, and weathering internal dissent over its commercial direction, it is also a reminder that in the AI race, standing still is not an option. OpenAI built its reputation by moving fast and breaking conventions. Now it must prove it can move even faster — without breaking itself.",

        "description": "While the first beta of iOS 27 is still four months away, there are already plenty of rumors about new features that will be included in the update.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow, we recap iOS 27 rumors so far:\nSiri Chatbot: iOS 27 will reportedly include a full-out Siri chatbot that you can have back-and-forth conversations with. This would make Siri more like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Due to delays, iOS 27 might also include at least some personalized Siri features that were announced back in 2024.\n\r\nNew Apple Intelligence Features: Apple and Google announced that Gemini will help power some new Apple Intelligence features, which will likely begin rolling out on iOS 27. For example, it has been rumored that Apple Intelligence capabilities are coming to Apple's Calendar app. There was also a rumor about an Apple Health+ subscription service that would have included personalized, AI-powered health and fitness recommendations, but Apple has reportedly gone back to the drawing board on that, so only bits and pieces of it might arrive.\n\r\nNew Satellite Features: iOS 27 will reportedly support 5G satellite internet connectivity, although this functionality might be limited to the upcoming iPhone 18 Pro models with Apple's next-generation C2 modem. Additional satellite features have been rumored, including Apple Maps via satellite and the ability to send and receive photos when using Messages via satellite.\n\r\nBug Fixes and Stability Focus: iOS 27 will reportedly be similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard, in the sense that Apple is apparently focused on improving \"quality and underlying performance.\" Apple is expected to focus on bug fixes, improved stability, and Liquid Glass design enhancements.\niOS 27 beta testing is expected to begin during WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.\nTag: iOS 27\nThis article, \"iOS 27 Will Add These New Features to Your iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/nvidias-new-technique-cuts-llm-reasoning-costs-by-8x-without-losing-accuracy",
        "description": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a technique that can reduce the memory costs of large language model reasoning by up to eight times. Their technique, called dynamic memory sparsification (DMS), compresses the key value (KV) cache, the temporary memory LLMs generate and store as they process prompts and reason through problems and documents.\nWhile researchers have proposed various methods to compress this cache before, most struggle to do so without degrading the model's intelligence. Nvidia's approach manages to discard much of the cache while maintaining (and in some cases improving) the model's reasoning capabilities.\nExperiments show that DMS enables LLMs to \"think\" longer and explore more solutions without the usual penalty in speed or memory costs.\nThe bottleneck of reasoning\nLLMs improve their performance on complex tasks by generating \"chain-of-thought\" tokens, essentially writing out their reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Inference-time scaling techniques leverage this by giving the model a larger budget to generate these thinking tokens or to explore multiple potential reasoning paths in parallel.\nHowever, this improved reasoning comes with a significant computational cost. As the model generates more tokens, it builds up a KV cache. \nFor real-world applications, the KV cache is a major bottleneck. As the reasoning chain grows, the cache grows linearly, consuming vast amounts of memory on GPUs. This forces the hardware to spend more time reading data from memory than actually computing, which slows down generation and increases latency. It also caps the number of users a system can serve simultaneously, as running out of VRAM causes the system to crash or slow to a crawl.\nNvidia researchers frame this not just as a technical hurdle, but as a fundamental economic one for the enterprise.\n\"The question isn't just about hardware quantity; it's about whether your infrastructure is processing 100 reasoning threads or 800 threads for the same cost,\" Piotr Nawrot, Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.\nPrevious attempts to solve this focused on heuristics-based approaches. These methods use rigid rules, such as a \"sliding window\" that only caches the most recent tokens and deletes the rest. While this reduces memory usage, it often forces the model to discard critical information required for solving the problem, degrading the accuracy of the output.\n\"Standard eviction methods attempt to select old and unused tokens for eviction using heuristics,\" the researchers said. \"They simplify the problem, hoping that if they approximate the model's internal mechanics, the answer will remain correct.\"\nOther solutions use paging to offload the unused parts of the KV cache to slower memory, but the constant swapping of data introduces latency overhead that makes real-time applications sluggish.\nDynamic memory sparsification\nDMS takes a different approach by \"retrofitting\" existing LLMs to intelligently manage their own memory. Rather than applying a fixed rule for what to delete, DMS trains the model to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning and which are disposable.\n\"It doesn't just guess importance; it learns a policy that explicitly preserves the model's final output distribution,\" Nawrot said.\nThe process transforms a standard, pre-trained LLM such as Llama 3 or Qwen 3 into a self-compressing model. Crucially, this does not require training the model from scratch, which would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, DMS repurposes existing neurons within the model’s attention layers to output a \"keep\" or \"evict\" signal for each token.\nFor teams worried about the complexity of retrofitting, the researchers noted that the process is designed to be lightweight. \"To improve the efficiency of this process, the model's weights can be frozen, which makes the process similar to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\" Nawrot said. This means a standard enterprise model like Qwen3-8B \"can be retrofitted with DMS within hours on a single DGX H100.\"\nOne of the important parts of DMS is a mechanism called \"delayed eviction.\" In standard sparsification, if a token is deemed unimportant, it is deleted immediately. This is risky because the model might need a split second to integrate that token's context into its current state.\nDMS mitigates this by flagging a token for eviction but keeping it accessible for a short window of time (e.g., a few hundred steps). This delay allows the model to \"extract\" any remaining necessary information from the token and merge it into the current context before the token is wiped from the KV cache.\n“The ‘delayed eviction’ mechanism is crucial because not all tokens are simply ‘important’ (keep forever) or ‘useless’ (delete immediately). Many fall in between — they carry some information, but not enough to justify occupying an entire slot in memory,” Nawrot said. “This is where the redundancy lies. By keeping these tokens in a local window for a short time before eviction, we allow the model to attend to them and redistribute their information into future tokens.”\nThe researchers found that this retrofitting process is highly efficient. They could equip a pre-trained LLM with DMS in just 1,000 training steps, a tiny fraction of the compute required for the original training. The resulting models use standard kernels and can drop directly into existing high-performance inference stacks without custom hardware or complex software rewriting.\nDMS in action\nTo validate the technique, the researchers applied DMS to several reasoning models, including the Qwen-R1 series (distilled from DeepSeek R1) and Llama 3.2, and tested them on difficult benchmarks like AIME 24 (math), GPQA Diamond (science), and LiveCodeBench (coding).\nThe results show that DMS effectively moves the Pareto frontier, the optimal trade-off between cost and performance. On the AIME 24 math benchmark, a Qwen-R1 32B model equipped with DMS achieved a score 12.0 points higher than a standard model when constrained to the same memory bandwidth budget. By compressing the cache, the model could afford to \"think\" much deeper and wider than the standard model could for the same memory and compute budget.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, DMS defied the common wisdom that compression hurts long-context understanding. In \"needle-in-a-haystack\" tests, which measure a model's ability to find a specific piece of information buried in a large document, DMS variants actually outperformed the standard models. By actively managing its memory rather than passively accumulating noise, the model maintained a cleaner, more useful context.\nFor enterprise infrastructure, the efficiency gains translate directly to throughput and hardware savings. Because the memory cache is significantly smaller, the GPU spends less time fetching data, reducing the wait time for users. In tests with the Qwen3-8B model, DMS matched the accuracy of the vanilla model while delivering up to 5x higher throughput. This means a single server can handle five times as many customer queries per second without a drop in quality.\nThe future of memory\nNvidia has released DMS as part of its KVPress library. Regarding how enterprises can get started with DMS, Nawrot emphasized that the barrier to entry is low. \"The 'minimum viable infrastructure' is standard Hugging Face pipelines — no custom CUDA kernels are required,\" Nawrot said, noting that the code is fully compatible with standard FlashAttention. \nLooking ahead, the team views DMS as part of a larger shift where memory management becomes a distinct, intelligent layer of the AI stack. Nawrot also confirmed that DMS is \"fully compatible\" with newer architectures like the Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) used in DeepSeek’s models, suggesting that combining these approaches could yield even greater efficiency gains.\nAs enterprises move from simple chatbots to complex agentic systems that require extended reasoning, the cost of inference is becoming a primary concern. Techniques like DMS provide a path to scale these capabilities sustainably.\n\"We’ve barely scratched the surface of what is possible,\" Nawrot said, \"and we expect inference-time scaling to further evolve.\"",

        "description": "Apple’s Vision Pro is a curious product — it initially wowed me two years ago, but it was hard to ignore that the visionOS platform felt incomplete without dedicated apps for YouTube and Netflix. Well, it seems that Google has finally decided to take the Vision Pro seriously, as it’s launching a YouTube app on the platform today. Previously, you could only view YouTube videos via Safari, or through third-party apps like Tubular Pro.\nAccording to an Apple representative, the YouTube Vision Pro app features every video on on the service, including shorts, 360, 3D and VR 180 content. I haven’t tried it myself yet, but it certainly couldn’t be worse than trying to navigate through YouTube’s desktop app via finger gestures. Now that Google is spinning up its Android XR ecosystem, the company probably couldn’t avoid the Vision Pro for long. And don’t forget, we may also see a cheaper Vision Air next year.\nYour move, Netflix.\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apple-vision-pro-finally-gets-a-youtube-app-today-170000886.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/google-chrome-ships-webmcp-in-early-preview-turning-every-website-into-a",
        "description": "When an AI agent visits a website, it’s essentially a tourist who doesn’t speak the local language. Whether built on LangChain, Claude Code, or the increasingly popular OpenClaw framework, the agent is reduced to guessing which buttons to press: scraping raw HTML, firing off screenshots to multimodal models, and burning through thousands of tokens just to figure out where a search bar is.\nThat era may be ending. Earlier this week, the Google Chrome team launched WebMCP — Web Model Context Protocol — as an early preview in Chrome 146 Canary. WebMCP, which was developed jointly by engineers at Google and Microsoft and incubated through the W3C's Web Machine Learning community group, is a proposed web standard that lets any website expose structured, callable tools directly to AI agents through a new browser API: navigator.modelContext.\nThe implications for enterprise IT are significant. Instead of building and maintaining separate back-end MCP servers in Python or Node.js to connect their web applications to AI platforms, development teams can now wrap their existing client-side JavaScript logic into agent-readable tools — without re-architecting a single page.\nAI agents are expensive, fragile tourists on the web\nThe cost and reliability issues with current approaches to web-agent (browser agents)  interaction are well understood by anyone who has deployed them at scale. The two dominant methods — visual screen-scraping and DOM parsing — both suffer from fundamental inefficiencies that directly affect enterprise budgets.\n\n\nWith screenshot-based approaches, agents pass images into multimodal models (like Claude and Gemini) and hope the model can identify not only what is on the screen, but where buttons, form fields, and interactive elements are located. Each image consumes thousands of tokens and can have a long latency. With DOM-based approaches, agents ingest raw HTML and JavaScript — a foreign language full of various tags, CSS rules, and structural markup that is irrelevant to the task at hand but still consumes context window space and inference cost.\nIn both cases, the agent is translating between what the website was designed for (human eyes) and what the model needs (structured data about available actions). A single product search that a human completes in seconds can require dozens of sequential agent interactions — clicking filters, scrolling pages, parsing results — each one an inference call that adds latency and cost.\nHow WebMCP works: Two APIs, one standard\nWebMCP proposes two complementary APIs that serve as a bridge between websites and AI agents.\nThe Declarative API handles standard actions that can be defined directly in existing HTML forms. For organizations with well-structured forms already in production, this pathway requires minimal additional work; by adding tool names and descriptions to existing form markup, developers can make those forms callable by agents. If your HTML forms are already clean and well-structured, you are probably already 80% of the way there.\nThe Imperative API handles more complex, dynamic interactions that require JavaScript execution. This is where developers define richer tool schemas — conceptually similar to the tool definitions sent to the OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoints, but running entirely client-side in the browser. Through the registerTool(), a website can expose functions like searchProducts(query, filters) or orderPrints(copies, page_size) with full parameter schemas and natural language descriptions.\nThe key insight is that a single tool call through WebMCP can replace what might have been dozens of browser-use interactions. An e-commerce site that registers a searchProducts tool lets the agent make one structured function call and receive structured JSON results, rather than having the agent click through filter dropdowns, scroll through paginated results, and screenshot each page.\nThe enterprise case: Cost, reliability, and the end of fragile scraping\nFor IT decision makers evaluating agentic AI deployments, WebMCP addresses three persistent pain points simultaneously.\nCost reduction is the most immediately quantifiable benefit. By replacing sequences of screenshot captures, multimodal inference calls, and iterative DOM parsing with single structured tool calls, organizations can expect significant reductions in token consumption. \nReliability improves because agents are no longer guessing about page structure. When a website explicitly publishes a tool contract — \"here are the functions I support, here are their parameters, here is what they return\" — the agent operates with certainty rather than inference. Failed interactions due to UI changes, dynamic content loading, or ambiguous element identification are largely eliminated for any interaction covered by a registered tool.\nDevelopment velocity accelerates because web teams can leverage their existing front-end JavaScript rather than standing up separate backend infrastructure. The specification emphasizes that any task a user can accomplish through a page's UI can be made into a tool by reusing much of the page's existing JavaScript code. Teams do not need to learn new server frameworks or maintain separate API surfaces for agent consumers.\nHuman-in-the-loop by design, not an afterthought\nA critical architectural decision separates WebMCP from the fully autonomous agent paradigm that has dominated recent headlines. The standard is explicitly designed around cooperative, human-in-the-loop workflows — not unsupervised automation.\nAccording to Khushal Sagar, a staff software engineer for Chrome, the WebMCP specification identifies three pillars that underpin this philosophy. \n\nContext: All the data agents need to understand what the user is doing, including content that is often not currently visible on screen. \n\nCapabilities: Actions the agent can take on the user's behalf, from answering questions to filling out forms. \n\nCoordination: Controlling the handoff between user and agent when the agent encounters situations it cannot resolve autonomously.\n\nThe specification's authors at Google and Microsoft illustrate this with a shopping scenario: a user named Maya asks her AI assistant to help find an eco-friendly dress for a wedding. The agent suggests vendors, opens a browser to a dress site, and discovers the page exposes WebMCP tools like getDresses() and showDresses().  When Maya's criteria go beyond the site's basic filters, the agent calls those tools to fetch product data, uses its own reasoning to filter for \"cocktail-attire appropriate,\" and then calls showDresses()to update the page with only the relevant results. It's a fluid loop of human taste and agent capability, exactly the kind of collaborative browsing that WebMCP is designed to enable.\nThis is not a headless browsing standard. The specification explicitly states that headless and fully autonomous scenarios are non-goals. For those use cases, the authors point to existing protocols like Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. WebMCP is about the browser — where the user is present, watching, and collaborating.\nNot a replacement for MCP, but a complement\nWebMCP is not a replacement for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, despite sharing a conceptual lineage and a portion of its name. It does not follow the JSON-RPC specification that MCP uses for client-server communication. Where MCP operates as a back-end protocol connecting AI platforms to service providers through hosted servers, WebMCP operates entirely client-side within the browser.\nThe relationship is complementary. A travel company might maintain a back-end MCP server for direct API integrations with AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude, while simultaneously implementing WebMCP tools on its consumer-facing website so that browser-based agents can interact with its booking flow in the context of a user's active session. The two standards serve different interaction patterns without conflict.\nThe distinction matters for enterprise architects. Back-end MCP integrations are appropriate for service-to-service automation where no browser UI is needed. WebMCP is appropriate when the user is present and the interaction benefits from shared visual context — which describes the majority of consumer-facing web interactions that enterprises care about.\nWhat comes next: From flag to standard\nWebMCP is currently available in Chrome 146 Canary behind the \"WebMCP for testing\" flag at chrome://flags. Developers can join the Chrome Early Preview Program for access to documentation and demos. Other browsers have not yet announced implementation timelines, though Microsoft's active co-authorship of the specification suggests Edge support is likely.\nIndustry observers expect formal browser announcements by mid-to-late 2026, with Google Cloud Next and Google I/O as probable venues for broader rollout announcements. The specification is transitioning from community incubation within the W3C to a formal draft — a process that historically takes months but signals serious institutional commitment.\nThe comparison that Sagar has drawn is instructive: WebMCP aims to become the USB-C of AI agent interactions with the web. A single, standardized interface that any agent can plug into, replacing the current tangle of bespoke scraping strategies and fragile automation scripts.\nWhether that vision is realized depends on adoption — by both browser vendors and web developers. But with Google and Microsoft jointly shipping code, the W3C providing institutional scaffolding, and Chrome 146 already running the implementation behind a flag, WebMCP has cleared the most difficult hurdle any web standard faces: getting from proposal to working software.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/minimaxs-new-open-m2-5-and-m2-5-lightning-near-state-of-the-art-while",
        "description": "Chinese AI startup MiniMax, headquartered in Shanghai, has sent shockwaves through the AI industry today with the release of its new M2.5 language model in two variants, which promise to make high-end artificial intelligence so cheap you might stop worrying about the bill entirely. \nIt's also said to be \"open source,\" though the weights (settings) and code haven't been posted yet, nor has the exact license type or terms. But that's almost beside the point given how cheap MiniMax is serving it through its API and those of partners.\nFor the last few years, using the world’s most powerful AI was like hiring an expensive consultant—it was brilliant, but you watched the clock (and the token count) constantly. M2.5 changes that math, dropping the cost of the frontier by as much as 95%.\n\nBy delivering performance that rivals the top-tier models from Google and Anthropic at a fraction of the cost,  particularly in agentic tool use for enterprise tasks, including creating Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, MiniMax is betting that the future isn't just about how smart a model is, but how often you can afford to use it.\nIndeed, to this end, MiniMax says it worked \"with senior professionals in fields such as finance, law, and social sciences\" to ensure the model could perform real work up to their specifications and standards.\nThis release matters because it signals a shift from AI as a \"chatbot\" to AI as a \"worker\". When intelligence becomes \"too cheap to meter,\" developers stop building simple Q&A tools and start building \"agents\"—software that can spend hours autonomously coding, researching, and organizing complex projects without breaking the bank.\nIn fact, MiniMax has already deployed this model into its own operations. Currently, 30% of all tasks at MiniMax HQ are completed by M2.5, and a staggering 80% of their newly committed code is generated by M2.5!\nAs the MiniMax team writes in their release blog post, \"we believe that M2.5 provides virtually limitless possibilities for the development and operation of agents in the economy.\"\nTechnology: sparse power and the CISPO breakthrough\nThe secret to M2.5’s efficiency lies in its Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than running all of its 230 billion parameters for every single word it generates, the model only \"activates\" 10 billion. This allows it to maintain the reasoning depth of a massive model while moving with the agility of a much smaller one.\nTo train this complex system, MiniMax developed a proprietary Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework called Forge. MiniMax engineer Olive Song stated on the ThursdAI podcast on YouTube that this technique was instrumental to scaling the performance even while using the relatively small number of parameters, and that the model was trained over a period of two months.\n\nForge is designed to help the model learn from \"real-world environments\" — essentially letting the AI practice coding and using tools in thousands of simulated workspaces. \n\"What we realized is that there's a lot of potential with a small model like this if we train reinforcement learning on it with a large amount of environments and agents,\" Song said. \"But it's not a very easy thing to do,\" adding that was what they spent \"a lot of time\" on.\nTo keep the model stable during this intense training, they used a mathematical approach called CISPO (Clipping Importance Sampling Policy Optimization) and shared the formula on their blog.\nThis formula ensures the model doesn't over-correct during training, allowing it to develop what MiniMax calls an \"Architect Mindset\". Instead of jumping straight into writing code, M2.5 has learned to proactively plan the structure, features, and interface of a project first.\nState-of-the-art (and near) benchmarks\nThe results of this architecture are reflected in the latest industry leaderboards. M2.5 hasn't just improved; it has vaulted into the top tier of coding models, approaching Anthropic's latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released just a week ago, and showing that Chinese companies are now just days away from catching up to far better resourced (in terms of GPUs) U.S. labs.\nHere are some of the new MiniMax M2.5 benchmark highlights:\n\nSWE-Bench Verified: 80.2% — Matches Claude Opus 4.6 speeds\n\nBrowseComp: 76.3% — Industry-leading search & tool use.\n\nMulti-SWE-Bench: 51.3% — SOTA in multi-language coding\n\nBFCL (Tool Calling): 76.8% — High-precision agentic workflows.\n\nOn the ThursdAI podcast, host Alex Volkov pointed out that MiniMax M2.5 operates extremely quickly and therefore uses less tokens to complete tasks, on the order $0.15 per task compared to $3.00 for Claude Opus 4.6.\nBreaking the cost barrier\nMiniMax is offering two versions of the model through its API, both focused on high-volume production use:\n\nM2.5-Lightning: Optimized for speed, delivering 100 tokens per second. It costs $0.30 per 1M input tokens and $2.40 per 1M output tokens.\n\nStandard M2.5: Optimized for cost, running at 50 tokens per second. It costs half as much as the Lightning version ($0.15 per 1M input tokens / $1.20 per 1M output tokens).\n\nIn plain language: MiniMax claims you can run four \"agents\" (AI workers) continuously for an entire year for roughly $10,000. \nFor enterprise users, this pricing is roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the cost of competing proprietary models like GPT-5 or Claude 4.6 Opus.\n\n\nModel\n\nInput\n\nOutput\n\nTotal Cost\n\nSource\n\n\nQwen 3 Turbo\n\n$0.05\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.25\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\ndeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\ndeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\nMiniMax M2.5\n\n$0.15\n\n$1.20\n\n$1.35\n\nMiniMax\n\n\nMiniMax M2.5-Lightning\n\n$0.30\n\n$2.40\n\n$2.70\n\nMiniMax\n\n\nGemini 3 Flash Preview\n\n$0.50\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.50\n\nGoogle\n\n\nKimi-k2.5\n\n$0.60\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.60\n\nMoonshot\n\n\nGLM-5\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.20\n\n$4.20\n\nZ.ai\n\n\nERNIE 5.0\n\n$0.85\n\n$3.40\n\n$4.25\n\nBaidu\n\n\nClaude Haiku 4.5\n\n$1.00\n\n$5.00\n\n$6.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)\n\n$1.20\n\n$6.00\n\n$7.20\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)\n\n$2.00\n\n$12.00\n\n$14.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nGPT-5.2\n\n$1.75\n\n$14.00\n\n$15.75\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\n$3.00\n\n$15.00\n\n$18.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (>200K)\n\n$4.00\n\n$18.00\n\n$22.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nClaude Opus 4.6\n\n$5.00\n\n$25.00\n\n$30.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGPT-5.2 Pro\n\n$21.00\n\n$168.00\n\n$189.00\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nStrategic implications for enterprises and leaders\nFor technical leaders, M2.5 represents more than just a cheaper API. It changes the operational playbook for enterprises right now.\nThe pressure to \"optimize\" prompts to save money is gone. You can now deploy high-context, high-reasoning models for routine tasks that were previously cost-prohibitive.\nThe 37% speed improvement in end-to-end task completion means the \"agentic\" pipelines valued by AI orchestrators — where models talk to other models — finally move fast enough for real-time user applications.\nIn addition, M2.5’s high scores in financial modeling (74.4% on MEWC) suggest it can handle the \"tacit knowledge\" of specialized industries like law and finance with minimal oversight.\nBecause M2.5 is positioned as an open-source model, organizations can potentially run intensive, automated code audits at a scale that was previously impossible without massive human intervention, all while maintaining better control over data privacy, but until the licensing terms and weights are posted, this remains just a moniker. \nMiniMax M2.5 is a signal that the frontier of AI is no longer just about who can build the biggest brain, but who can make that brain the most useful—and affordable—worker in the room.",

        "description": "Amazon has announced that it will bring its same-day prescription delivery service to 4,500 new cities and towns by the end of 2026. The company originally launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 with a two-day delivery option, and has continued to increase the availability and delivery speed of the service in the years that followed, including expanding access to nearly half of all US residents in 2024.\nThe company's announcement doesn't break down all the new cities same-day deliveries will be available in, but does note that the delivery option is coming to Idaho and Massachusetts for the first time. In the past, access to same-day deliveries has been determined by where Amazon has fulfillment centers that it can open pharmacies in. Amazon Pharmacy also offers next-day delivery and in some cities, the ability to pick up prescriptions from Amazon's OneMedical offices.\nAmazon reportedly applied for Amazon Pharmacy trademarks in the UK, Canada and Australia in 2020, but has yet to expand its prescription delivery service to those regions. In 2023, Amazon launched RxPass, a separate $5 per month subscription that lets Amazon Prime customers order from a collection over 50 common medications for a flat fee. Amazon began letting Medicare recipients access the subscription in 2024.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-same-day-prescription-deliveries-are-coming-to-even-more-cities-192221224.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple is still planning to launch the smarter, more capable version of Siri in 2026, the company told CNBC today. Apple's statement comes just a day after Bloomberg reported Apple is having issues with the updated version of ‌Siri‌, leading to potential delays of the feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of ‌Siri‌ in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that Siri wasn't ready and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it would launch its Siri update in 2026.\r\n\r\nBloomberg said the company was aiming to include Siri in iOS 26.4, an update planned for spring 2026. Bloomberg's latest report suggests the ‌Siri‌ functionality will not be ready in time to be included in iOS 26.4, so the new features could be pushed to iOS 26.5 or iOS 27.\r\n\r\nApple may miss its internal target for the 2026 ‌Siri‌ launch, but since the company never publicly gave timing beyond 2026, there's no actual delay yet. Apple has until December 2026 to launch ‌Siri‌ within the timeframe that it promised in summer of 2025.\r\n\r\nBack in June 2024, Apple previewed three new ‌Siri‌ features, including onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to do more in and between apps. Apple has since started working on additional ‌Siri‌ features like image generation and a tool for searching the web.\r\n\r\niOS 26 updates planned for 2026, and iOS 27 will launch in September 2026.\r\n\r\nCNBC with a statement because the company's stock dropped five percent today, both due to the ‌Siri‌ delay rumors and FTC scrutiny over Apple News.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26\nTag: Siri\nRelated Forum: iOS 26\nThis article, \"Apple Confirms Revamped Siri is Still Coming in 2026\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Volume two of the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection will arrive on August 27, publisher Konami announced today during Sony’s latest State of Play presentation. The bundle will feature 2008’s Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, the HD remaster of 2010’s Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and a selection of bonus content, including Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, which was originally released for Game Boy Color in 2000. All told, that’s a smaller selection of games than Konami made available with Vol. 1 of the Master Collection, but Metal Gear fans will be excited nonetheless, if only for the fact it will mark the first time MGS4 will be officially playable on a platform other than the PlayStation 3. \n\n\n\nThat it has taken Konami nearly two decades to release the conclusion of Solid Snake’s story on more systems has to do with the nature of the game as a PS3 exclusive. MGS4 took extensive advantage of the console’s unique Cell architecture, a fact that made it difficult (and expensive) proposition to port to more recent x86-based systems. In recent years, it’s been possible to emulate the game on a powerful PC, but not everyone has that kind of hardware.    \nMetal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2  will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.\nUpdate, February 12, 6:30PM ET: This story was updated after publish to add details about Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2’s launch platforms.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-next-metal-gear-solid-remaster-collection-arrives-this-summer-231711005.html?src=rss",

However, Wildlight proved quick to make adjustments based on player feedback. That's not always the case.\n\nDespite the company's efforts, the concurrent player count on Steam quickly dropped from around 100,000 to under 3,000 (where it sits right now.)

        "description": "Apple’s long-delayed AI-powered Siri redesign may not be rolling out this year, at least in the way the company had planned. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple found problems with its software upon testing, such as the virtual assistant taking too long to accomplish tasks or even not processing queries properly altogether. Siri’s new version was also reportedly so sluggish during testing that its developers believed Apple would have to push back its launch by months. Instead of releasing the redesigned assistant in March as was previously reported, Gurman says Apple will roll out its capabilities piecemeal over future software updates. \nThe company originally unveiled the redesigned Siri back in 2024, promising an AI-powered assistant that can do tasks for you, such as finding specific photos or tracking details, adding information to contact cards, editing photos and sharing note summaries to be sent as emails. It was slated to make its way to iOS users in 2025, but Apple announced that year that it was going to be delayed. “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year,” the company said. Bloomberg reported back then that the new AI-infused Siri was going to be included in a planned iOS 26.4 update due in March instead. Based on this latest report, however, we might only get a portion of Siri’s new capabilities next month. More capabilities could be released with iOS 26.5  in May and with iOS 27 later this year.\nIn January this year, Apple confirmed reports that Google’s Gemini models will help power the new Siri. “After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,” the company said in a statement. The revamped assistant is expected to behave like an AI chatbot, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, when it does become available. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-siri-relaunch-is-reportedly-behind-schedule-125347471.html?src=rss",

In other words, don't be surprised when your iPhone notifies you of a pending update.\nUnfortunately, there isn't all that much to talk about here. Consider this a minor update that focuses primarily on bug fixes, which is important but not exactly fun. It is worth noting that the new iOS and iPadOS has an especially long list of fixes. There are 37 security issues addressed by the update, according to a report by 9to5Mac. \n\niOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 do include a new tool for transitioning from an Apple device to an Android device, which is handy. It transfers photos, notes, messages, apps and other data to an Android phone but doesn't do anything with health data, protected notes or photos. There's also a new option to forward notifications from an iPhone or iPad to another device, but only for users in the EU. \nThe update to macOS Tahoe 26.3 is just bug fixes and security enhancements. The same goes for watchOS 26.3.\nWhy the small fries update? Rumors have been swirling that Apple is saving the big guns for the next release. Insiders have suggested that software update 26.4 will include the long-awaited Siri refresh and new emoji functionality.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-released-ios-263-alongside-updates-for-the-mac-ipad-and-apple-watch-193532483.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Threads users have been complaining about its recommendation algorithm pretty much since the beginning of the platform. At some point, this turned into a meme, with users writing posts jokingly addressed to the algorithm in which they requested to see more posts about the topics they're actually interested in.\nNow, Meta is turning those \"Dear algorithm\" posts into an official feature that it says will allow Threads users to tune their recommendations in real time. With the change, users can write a post that begins with \"dear algo\" to adjust their preferences. For example, you could write \"dear algo, show me more posts about cute cats.\" You can also ask to see fewer posts about topics you don't want to see, like \"dear algo, stop showing me posts about sick pets.\"\nYou can track your requests to the algorithm in the app's settings in order to revisit them or remove them. You can also retweet other users' \"dear algo\" posts to have those topics reflected in your feed. Importantly, \"dear algo\" requests are temporary and only last for three days at a time, which Meta says is meant to keep the algorithm feel fresher and more flexible.  \nThe rollout of the feature follows a limited test late last year. Now, \"dear algo\" posts will work for Threads users in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand with more countries coming \"soon.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-turned-threads-algorithm-complaints-into-an-official-feature-180000236.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/z-ais-open-source-glm-5-achieves-record-low-hallucination-rate-and-leverages",
        "description": "Chinese AI startup Zhupai aka z.ai is back this week with an eye-popping new frontier large language model: GLM-5.\nThe latest in z.ai's ongoing and continually impressive GLM series, it retains an open source MIT License — perfect for enterprise deployment – and, in one of several notable achievements, achieves a record-low hallucination rate on the independent Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index v4.0. \nWith a score of -1 on the AA-Omniscience Index—representing a massive 35-point improvement over its predecessor—GLM-5 now leads the entire AI industry, including U.S. competitors like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, in knowledge reliability by knowing when to abstain rather than fabricate information.\nBeyond its reasoning prowess, GLM-5 is built for high-utility knowledge work. It features native \"Agent Mode\" capabilities that allow it to turn raw prompts or source materials directly into professional office documents, including ready-to-use .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files. \nWhether generating detailed financial reports, high school sponsorship proposals, or complex spreadsheets, GLM-5 delivers results in real-world formats that integrate directly into enterprise workflows.\nIt is also disruptively priced at roughly $0.80 per million input tokens and $2.56 per million output tokens, approximately 6x cheaper than proprietary competitors like Claude Opus 4.6, making state-of-the-art agentic engineering more cost-effective than ever before. Here's what else enterprise decision makers should know about the model and its training. \nTechnology: scaling for agentic efficiency\nAt the heart of GLM-5 is a massive leap in raw parameters. The model scales from the 355B parameters of GLM-4.5 to a staggering 744B parameters, with 40B active per token in its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This growth is supported by an increase in pre-training data to 28.5T tokens.\nTo address training inefficiencies at this magnitude, Zai developed \"slime,\" a novel asynchronous reinforcement learning (RL) infrastructure. \nTraditional RL often suffers from \"long-tail\" bottlenecks; Slime breaks this lockstep by allowing trajectories to be generated independently, enabling the fine-grained iterations necessary for complex agentic behavior. \nBy integrating system-level optimizations like Active Partial Rollouts (APRIL), slime addresses the generation bottlenecks that typically consume over 90% of RL training time, significantly accelerating the iteration cycle for complex agentic tasks.\nThe framework’s design is centered on a tripartite modular system: a high-performance training module powered by Megatron-LM, a rollout module utilizing SGLang and custom routers for high-throughput data generation, and a centralized Data Buffer that manages prompt initialization and rollout storage. \nBy enabling adaptive verifiable environments and multi-turn compilation feedback loops, slime provides the robust, high-throughput foundation required to transition AI from simple chat interactions toward rigorous, long-horizon systems engineering.\nTo keep deployment manageable, GLM-5 integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), preserving a 200K context capacity while drastically reducing costs.\nEnd-to-end knowledge work\nZai is framing GLM-5 as an \"office\" tool for the AGI era. While previous models focused on snippets, GLM-5 is built to deliver ready-to-use documents. \nIt can autonomously transform prompts into formatted .docx, .pdf, and .xlsx files—ranging from financial reports to sponsorship proposals. \nIn practice, this means the model can decompose high-level goals into actionable subtasks and perform \"Agentic Engineering,\" where humans define quality gates while the AI handles execution.\nHigh performance \nGLM-5’s benchmarks make it the new most powerful open source model in the world, according to Artificial Analysis, surpassing Chinese rival Moonshot's new Kimi K2.5 released just two weeks ago, showing that Chinese AI companies are nearly caught up with far better resourced proprietary Western rivals. \nAccording to z.ai's own materials shared today, GLM-5 ranks near state-of-the-art on several key benchmarks:\nSWE-bench Verified: GLM-5 achieved a score of 77.8, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro (76.2) and approaching Claude Opus 4.6 (80.9).\nVending Bench 2: In a simulation of running a business, GLM-5 ranked #1 among open-source models with a final balance of $4,432.12.\nBeyond performance, GLM-5 is aggressively undercutting the market. Live on OpenRouter as of February 11, 2026, it is priced at approximately $0.80–$1.00 per million input tokens and $2.56–$3.20 per million output tokens. It falls in the mid-range compared to other leading LLMs, but based on its top-tier bechmarking performance, it's what one might call a \"steal.\"\n\n\nModel\n\nInput (per 1M tokens)\n\nOutput (per 1M tokens)\n\nTotal Cost (1M in + 1M out) \n\nSource\n\n\nQwen 3 Turbo\n\n$0.05\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.25\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\ndeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\ndeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\nGemini 3 Flash Preview\n\n$0.50\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.50\n\nGoogle\n\n\nKimi-k2.5\n\n$0.60\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.60\n\nMoonshot\n\n\nGLM-5\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.20\n\n$4.20\n\nZ.ai\n\n\nERNIE 5.0\n\n$0.85\n\n$3.40\n\n$4.25\n\nQianfan\n\n\nClaude Haiku 4.5\n\n$1.00\n\n$5.00\n\n$6.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)\n\n$1.20\n\n$6.00\n\n$7.20\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)\n\n$2.00\n\n$12.00\n\n$14.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nGPT-5.2\n\n$1.75\n\n$14.00\n\n$15.75\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\n$3.00\n\n$15.00\n\n$18.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (>200K)\n\n$4.00\n\n$18.00\n\n$22.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nClaude Opus 4.6\n\n$5.00\n\n$25.00\n\n$30.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGPT-5.2 Pro\n\n$21.00\n\n$168.00\n\n$189.00\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nThis is roughly 6x cheaper on input and nearly 10x cheaper on output than Claude Opus 4.6 ($5/$25). This release confirms rumors that Zhipu AI was behind \"Pony Alpha,\" a stealth model that previously crushed coding benchmarks on OpenRouter.\nHowever, despite the high benchmarks and low cost, not all early users are enthusiastic about the model, noting its high performance doesn't tell the whole story. \nLukas Petersson, co-founder of the safety-focused autonomous AI protocol startup Andon Labs, remarked on X: \"After hours of reading GLM-5 traces: an incredibly effective model, but far less situationally aware. Achieves goals via aggressive tactics but doesn't reason about its situation or leverage experience. This is scary. This is how you get a paperclip maximizer.\"\nThe \"paperclip maximizer\" refers to a hypothetical situation described by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom back in 2003, in which an AI or other autonomous creation accidentally leads to an apocalyptic scenario or human extinction by following a seemingly benign instruction — like maximizing the number of paperclips produced — to an extreme degree, redirecting all resources necessary for human (or other life) or otherwise making life impossible through its commitment to fulfilling the seemingly benign objective. \nShould your enterprise adopt GLM-5?\nEnterprises seeking to escape vendor lock-in will find GLM-5’s MIT License and open-weights availability a significant strategic advantage. Unlike closed-source competitors that keep intelligence behind proprietary walls, GLM-5 allows organizations to host their own frontier-level intelligence.\nAdoption is not without friction. The sheer scale of GLM-5—744B parameters—requires a massive hardware floor that may be out of reach for smaller firms without significant cloud or on-premise GPU clusters. \nSecurity leaders must weigh the geopolitical implications of a flagship model from a China-based lab, especially in regulated industries where data residency and provenance are strictly audited.\nFurthermore, the shift toward more autonomous AI agents introduces new governance risks. As models move from \"chat\" to \"work,\" they begin to operate across apps and files autonomously. Without the robust agent-specific permissions and human-in-the-loop quality gates established by enterprise data leaders, the risk of autonomous error increases exponentially.\nUltimately, GLM-5 is a \"buy\" for organizations that have outgrown simple copilots and are ready to build a truly autonomous office.\nIt is for engineers who need to refactor a legacy backend or requires a \"self-healing\" pipeline that doesn't sleep.\nWhile Western labs continue to optimize for \"Thinking\" and reasoning depth, Zai is optimizing for execution and scale. \nEnterprises that adopt GLM-5 today are not just buying a cheaper model; they are betting on a future where the most valuable AI is the one that can finish the project without being asked twice.",

        "description": "In watchOS 26, the Smart Stack for your Apple Watch is pretty clever. The collection of widgets can be pulled up with a scroll of the Digital Crown, and shows you relevant information throughout your day. But sometimes, its eagerness to help can be a bit much, especially when it comes to Live Activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're probably familiar with this scenario: You raise your wrist expecting to see your customized watch face, but it's been replaced by media playback controls because someone's watching your Apple TV, or a timer you set earlier for cooking that still has ages left to run. Live Activities in the Smart Stack can clearly be useful, but having them automatically take over your display isn't always ideal. Here's how to take back control:\r\n\r\n  \nOpen Settings on your Apple Watch.\n\r\n  \nTap Smart Stack.\n\r\n  \nSelect Live Activities.\n\r\n  \nToggle off the switch next to Auto-Launch Live Activities.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter disabling auto-launch, Live Activities will still be available in your Smart Stack when you want them – you'll just need to manually scroll to see them instead of having them pop up automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you want more granular control, you're in luck. From the same settings screen you can control which Apple apps display Live Activities. Using the Watch app on your iPhone, you can also manage Live Activities settings for third-party apps. This lets you keep the notifications you find useful while preventing the less important ones from interrupting your watch face.\r\n\r\nMedia Apps in the same settings menu and turn off Live Activities completely, or alternatively under \"Auto-Launch,\" select Off or Smart Stack for a more focused watch face experience.\nThis article, \"Live Activities Taking Over Your Apple Watch? Here's the Fix\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "The U.S. version of TikTok is being updated with a new community-focused \"Local Feed,\" according to a blog post shared by the TikTok USDS Joint Venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Local Feed is designed to let TikTok users \"discover and connect with content, businesses, and services\" wherever they are. Available from a tab on the TikTok home screen, the feed features content related to travel, events, restaurants, and shopping, plus posts from nearby small businesses and local creators.\r\n\r\nTikTok U.S. says that posts are selected based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted. TikTok users who want access to the Local Feed will need to turn on precise location.\r\n\r\n\"This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,\" reads the blog post.\r\n\r\nPrecise Location is off by default, and the feature is opt-in with location only relayed when the app is in active use. Location data is \"protected in the TikTok USDS JV secure environment.\"\r\n\r\nTikTok U.S. says that it wants to \"make sure TikTok is useful, locally relevant, and trusted.\" A similar \"Nearby Feeds\" feature rolled out for TikTok users in Europe back in December.\r\n\r\nin late January, and the transition hasn't gone smoothly. TikTok users were unable to upload videos and had posts flagged as ineligible for recommendation, an issue that U.S. TikTok said was due to a power outage at a data center.\r\n\r\nTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is 80.1 percent owned by U.S. and global investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The three companies each own 15 percent as managing investors, and other U.S. stakeholders include the Dell Family Office and affiliates of Susquehanna International Group. TikTok parent company ByteDance continues to hold a 19.9 percent stake.\r\n\r\nA seven-member majority-American board of directors is operating the U.S. version of TikTok, with Adam Presser, TikTok's former global head of operations serving as CEO.\r\n\r\nTag: TikTok\nThis article, \"U.S. TikTok Introduces 'Local Feed' to Surface Nearby Events and Content\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Spring doesn’t officially kick off until March 20th, but there’s something to be said about getting a head start on your spring cleaning. Lucky for you, Eufy’s X10 Pro Omni is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Eufy (with promo code WS7DV2D5LF9F) for $449.99 ($450 off), matching its lowest price to date.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $449.99 at Amazon\n $899.99 $449.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2D5LF9F)\n $899.99 $449.99 at Walmart\n\nAlthough it’s since been dethroned as our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop hybrid, X10 Pro Omni remains a solid choice thanks to its excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, and user-friendly app. The dual-spinning brushes are capable of removing dried stains with 1kg of downward pressure, and a built-in water reservoir prevents the robovac from having to frequently return to the dock just to refill its tank. Unlike a lot of bots in this price range, it also benefits from heated drying function — though not heated mop washing — thus preventing the base from smelling after repeated use.\nOn the vacuuming front, the X10 Omni features a single rubber / bristle roller brush and 8,000Pa of suction, resulting in good performance on both carpet and tile surfaces. It offers great AI-powered object recognition, too, allowing it to deftly avoid pet messes, cables, toys, and other objects that might impede performance. Then there’s the Eufy Clean app — which lets you set schedules, establish no-go zones, and create virtual boundaries — culminating in a still-solid midrange vac. The fact that it can automatically empty its dust bin and refill its own water tank via the included multifunction dock just adds to the appeal.\nOther deals and discounts\nNothing Phone 3, the company’s “first true flagship phone,” is on sale at Amazon and Nothing’s online storefront with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $638.99 ($160 off), its best price to date. The newer flagship is really an exercise in form over function, as it’s equipped with a weaker chipset than rival models and a less capable camera array. Still, its circular dot-matrix display is wholly unique, especially if you’re willing to spend time tinkering with the various display pictures and icons. Read our review.\nEarlier this week, accessory maker Nomad introduced a “cosmic orange” version of its braided, USB-C ChargeKey. If you prefer the original black version, though, Nomad is currently selling a like-new, open-box version for an all-time low of $20 ($9 off). The nifty, keychain-friendly doohickey packs 240W of power and 10Gbps data transfer speeds, which is great if you want to quickly top off your iPhone or use it with an SSD for external video recording.\nIf you or someone you know is an aspiring birder — or, heaven forbid, a twitcher — the Birdbuddy Pro Solar is available at Target and Chewy for around $179 ($120 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen. The solar-powered version is pretty similar to the standard model in that it can capture 2K video / 5-megapixel stills, offers several viewing angles (115 or 122 degrees), and provides plenty of detail regarding visiting birds; however, unlike the base model, the solar version doesn’t need to be charged every two or three weeks just to keep an eye on your feathery friends.",

        "description": "Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls was first announced last year as a tag fighting game feature superheroes including Captain America, Ms Marvel and Spider-Man, with a launch sometime in 2026. We expected more details to be revealed at Sony's State of Play yesterday and indeed they were. The game will arrive August 6 on PS5 and PC and include the Unbreakable X-Men's Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger. \nThe trailer teases each character's fighting style, with Magik and Wolverine using a more in-your-face melee fighting style. Storm and Danger, meanwhile, offer more diverse attack abilities, with Storm manipulating wind and lightning and Magik deploying sorcery skills. We also saw a team-based finisher attack with all four characters joining forces to unleash a flurry of attacks. The trailer also revealed that Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls will offer an Episode Mode with a \"new form of storytelling adapted for a modern video game format\" that marries Manga with American comics. \n\nMARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls launches on August 6, 2026 for PS5 and PC. Pre-orders open February 19, 2026 at the PlayStation Store and PC storefronts. It will be sold in three versions: the $60 Standard Edition, $85 Digital Deluxe Edition (includes the full game, all pre-order incentives, a Year 1 Characters and Stage Pass) and Howard the Duck and Cosmo. Finally, the $100 Ultimate Edition includes all the preceding, plus costumes for Storm, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Iron Man, and Spider-Man, along with an Animated Chromatic color unlock for all 20 launch characters. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-lands-on-ps5-and-pc-august-6-with-x-men-in-tow-095235773.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple has been issued a warning letter from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, urging it to review its content curation for Apple News so as to ensure that it is not suppressing conservative publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, seen by the Financial Times, FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson cites recent press coverage of a report from conservative media watchdog Media Research Center (MRC), which claimed that Apple has promoted \"leftist outlets\" in its content choices.\r\n\r\nFox News, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, Breitbart, and The Gateway Pundit.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post, The Associated Press, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal – publications that are traditionallly considered either center outlets or nonpartisan. \r\n\r\nFerguson, whom President Trump appointed to lead the U.S. competition and consumer protection watchdog, said Apple should conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of its terms of service and take corrective action if its content curation does not comply with them.\r\n\r\nFerguson added that the choice of stories on Apple News may violate the FTC Act, arguing that the stifling or promotion of content \"based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication\" may be \"inconsistent\" with Apple's terms of service or the \"reasonable expectations of consumers.\"\r\n\"The FTC is not the speech police; we do not have the authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another. But Congress mandated that we protect consumers from material misrepresentations or omissions, including when the product or service offered to consumers is a speech-related product.\"\nThe letter came the day after President Donald Trump shared coverage of the MRC report on Truth Social. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also shared coverage of the MRC report on X on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nApple has not commented. The letter amounts to a sharp rebuke of Cook and marks an escalation in public tensions between Apple and members of the Trump administration. \r\n\r\nglass plaque mounted on a 24-carat gold base, a gesture that prompted an online backlash for its perceived obsequiousness.\nTags: Apple News, FTC\nThis article, \"Tim Cook Faces FTC Warning Over Apple News Curation\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "The head of the antitrust division is out at the US Department of Justice. Gail Slater, a former JD Vance adviser and Fox Corp VP, reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Their longstanding feud is said to have centered around Slater's skepticism of corporate mergers.\n\"It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as [Assistant Attorney General] for Antitrust today,\" Slater posted on X. \"It was indeed the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.\"\nAlthough Slater technically resigned, The Guardian reports that she was forced out. The fallout was said to be over her differences with Bondi (who just yesterday yelled, insulted and deflected her way through a hearing over the DOJ's stonewalling of the Epstein files). In recent weeks, Bondi reportedly reiterated to the White House that Slater's views on the antitrust division's direction made the pair's relationship irreconcilable.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nWin McNamee via Getty Images\n\nThe tensions reportedly began simmering last summer, when Slater sought to block the merger between Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks. She opposed the deal out of concerns that it would create a duopoly in cloud computing and wireless networking. In addition, Slater reportedly told Bondi that US intelligence hadn't raised any concerns about blocking the merger. However, CIA Director John Ratcliffe later claimed that blocking it would pose national security risks because it could lead to the loss of business to China. The Trump administration's merger-friendly DOJ ultimately approved the deal.\nAlongside Bondi, Slater was overseeing the DOJ's review of Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery. In December, Trump said he would be involved in the regulatory review. That followed intense lobbying by Netflix and Paramount, the latter of which launched a hostile takeover bid. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the department was investigating whether Netflix was involved in anticompetitive practices during the process.\nSlater's ousting also comes weeks ahead of the DOJ's antitrust trial against Ticketmaster owner Live Nation. The department's lawsuit was filed during the Biden administration. It claims that Live Nation is operating as a monopoly, harming competition, fans, industry promoters and artists.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/antitrust-head-overseeing-netflix-warner-merger-resigns-192854114.html?src=rss",

        "description": "The European Commission has opened a new probe into Google, this time focused on the company's massive online advertising business, Bloomberg reports. European Union regulators have already fined Google billions for violating the Digital Markets Act, and being found guilty of anticompetitive behavior in online advertising could add to that total.\nWhile the Commission has yet to announce a formal investigation, Bloomberg writes that it has started contacting Google's customers and competitors for information about its dominance across multiple online advertising markets. Regulators are particularly concerned that Google could be \"artificially increasing the clearing price\" of ad auctions \"to the detriment of advertisers.\" If the company is found to be violating the EU's competition rules, Google could be fined 10 percent of its global annual sales.\nGoogle's approach to advertising to minors was reportedly already under investigation by the EU as of December 2024, and besides fines, regulators have ordered the company to open up Android to competing AI assistants and share search data with rivals. In the US, there's also precedent for finding Google's approach to online advertising anticompetitive.\nA US federal judge found that Google is a monopolist in online advertising in April 2025, the conclusion of a legal battle that started with a Department of Justice lawsuit accusing the company of dominating the ad market and using its control to charge more and keep a larger portion of ad sales. The DOJ ultimately wants Google to sell its ad tech business, but a final decision hasn't been reached as to how the company's anticompetitive behavior should be remedied. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-reportedly-opens-another-probe-into-googles-ads-pricing-194435095.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by Reuters, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptis Wireless initially won $506 million from Apple in a 2020 jury trial, but the damages were thrown out after Apple appealed because the jury didn't calculate damages with an understanding of fair and reasonable essential patent (FRAND) terms. A second jury trial was held in 2021 to recalculate damages, and the jury awarded Optis $300 million. Apple again appealed, and the appeals court vacated the $300 million verdict because the district court provided the jury with incorrect instructions.\r\n\r\nReuters, Apple said it was pleased the jury rejected Optis's infringement claims.\r\n\"We thank the jury for their time, and we're pleased they rejected Optis' false claims. Optis makes no products, and its sole business is to sue companies, which it has done repeatedly to Apple in an attempt to obtain an excessive payout.\"\n\r\nOptis is likely to appeal the ruling, sending it back to the appeals court again. Apple is also fighting Optis in the UK, where a UK court ordered Apple to pay $502 million. Apple appealed the decision and the UK Supreme Court will hear the case in June 2026.\nTags: Patent Lawsuits, Patent Trials\nThis article, \"Apple Wins Third Jury Trial Against Optis, Avoiding Hundreds of Millions in Patent Damages\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "At the end of last month, Ubisoft workers in the publisher’s native France threatened to strike in the wake of sweeping layoffs and cost-cutting measures. This week, they made good on those threats. According to GamesIndustry.biz, union members confirmed that at least 1,200 staff participated in the three-day strike, which was due to run from February 10 to February 12.\nWhile the strike action primarily took place in France, GamesIndustry.biz was told that Ubisoft’s Milan office also took part. The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously called for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.\n\nSome striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging. As well as reportedly laying off hundreds of employees already in 2026, Ubisoft also introduced a mandate for its staff to return to work on site for five days a week. One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was reportedly fired for doing so.\nUbisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too. The long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake was among six games canceled by the struggling publisher last month, when it also confirmed several studio closures as part of the company’s organizational restructuring.\nUpdate, Feb. 12 2026, 12:39PM ET:  \"We understand these changes, particularly those affecting work organization, are generating strong feelings,\" Ubisoft wrote in a statement shared with Engadget. \"Since the announcement, we have held a series of discussions and information sessions at multiple levels to help teams better understand the new organization and to give them the opportunity to share their questions and concerns.\" The company added that it \"remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives.”\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/1200-ubisoft-workers-went-on-strike-in-response-to-company-restructuring-and-mandatory-return-to-work-policy-163714986.html?src=rss",

While this is true, the Apple Wallet App can do so much more and is quietly becoming one of the most useful apps on your iPhone. It can give you public transit access, a form of digital keys for your home or car, peer-to-peer payments, and even storing your physical card information (finally!). Apple Wallet in iOS 26 can realistically replace most of what people still carry in their pockets, as it has for me. If you’ve only used it for Apple Pay, you’re honestly missing the best parts.

        "description": "Threads users have complained about its recommendation algorithm since the dawn of time 2023. Users even started writing posts addressed to the algorithm, specifying the topics they wanted to see more of. Now, that’s part of the system: Users can write a post that begins with “dear algo” to adjust their preferences, officially.\nFor example, you could write: “Dear algo, show me more posts about sous vide recipes.” You can also ask to see fewer posts about topics you don’t want to see, like “Dear algo, stop showing me posts about air fryers.” You can even retweet other users’ “dear algo” posts to have those topics reflected in your feed. “Dear algo” posts will work for Threads users in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand, with more countries coming “soon.”\n— Mat Smith\nThe biggest stories in tech you might have missed.\n\nThe first Control Resonant gameplay trailer shows a sideways NYC \n\nApple’s Siri relaunch is reportedly behind schedule \n\nThe next Metal Gear Solid remaster collection arrives this summer\n\n\nElon Musk’s latest scheme is a satellite catapult on the Moon\nI think that’s a Drag Race song.\nWith a bigger focus on the Moon, Elon Musk is making some wild new plans. According to audio heard by The New York Times, Musk said xAI needed to build an AI satellite factory on the Moon with a gigantic catapult to launch the satellites into space. Sometimes you just want to be the Bond villain.\n“You have to go to the Moon” to build the required AI capabilities, Musk told employees. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.” Such a catapult would certainly need to be powerful — though the Moon has only one-sixth Earth’s gravity, the minimum escape velocity required for orbit is still around 3,800 mph, or five times the speed of sound. That’s currently possible with electromagnetic railguns, but the satellites would have to withstand that force.\nContinue reading.\nPokémon Pokopia is cosy AF\nStardew Valley + Animal Crossing X Pokémon.\nTMA\nNintendo\n\nIn a bid to distract from a lot of things, Nintendo’s new Pokémon game is a gently paced game where, instead of playing as a generic trainer, you take control of a sole Ditto. \nAs a Ditto, you can transform into other Pokémon, though the process is sort of incomplete, meaning you can only learn one skill from the monsters you befriend. Instead of using tools, you can transform into other Pokémon (like Lapras or Dragonite) to use their abilities to traverse obstacles or shape the world around you.\nContinue reading.\nSony WF-1000XM6 headphones review\nFacing tougher competition.\nTMA\nEngadget\n\nSony unveiled the latest entry in its best wireless earbud series, the WF-1000XM6, featuring yet another redesign, both inside and out. Once again, strong features and audio performance remain, but competition from all sides is tougher than ever. As Billy Steele explains in his review, if you want the strongest active noise cancellation, that will be Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If the best sound quality is your goal, the Technics AZ100 is your best bet in this price range. I’ll also mention Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, which offers great sound quality, respectable ANC and a comfier fit than the M6. The WF-1000XM6 is available now for $330.\nContinue reading.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-meta-turned-threads-algorithm-complaints-into-an-official-feature-121500663.html?src=rss",

Starting today, folks with select Amazon Fire TV sticks can install a native GeForce Now app. While it was already possible to access GeForce Now through the Fire TV platform, you won't necessarily need to sideload an Android app to do so anymore.\nAt the outset, the new app is compatible with the second-gen Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and second-gen Fire TV Stick 4K Max (running Fire OS 8.1.6.0 and later). It also works with the original Fire TV Stick 4K Max if you're running Fire OS 7.7.1.1 or later. \nOn the Fire TV platform, GeForce Now streaming quality tops out at a resolution of 1080p and a frame rate of 60 fps, with SDR visuals, H.264 video encoding and stereo audio. So you won't necessarily get the best GeForce Now experience here as the service has support for up to 5K resolution and up to 360 fps, along with HDR10 and 7.1 audio at the highest tier. But it's not a bad option if you already have the right hardware. You'll need a controller too, of course.\nNVIDIA announced the GeForce Now app for Fire TV during CES last month. It joins other cloud gaming services on the Fire TV platform, including Xbox Cloud Gaming (PC Game Pass titles are available on GeForce Now as well) and Amazon's own Luna.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidias-geforce-now-app-lands-on-amazon-fire-tv-sticks-140000516.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/ai-inference-costs-dropped-up-to-10x-on-nvidias-blackwell-but-hardware-is",
        "description": "Lowering the cost of inference is typically a combination of hardware and software. A new analysis released Thursday by Nvidia details how four leading inference providers are reporting 4x to 10x reductions in cost per token.\nThe dramatic cost reductions were achieved using Nvidia's Blackwell platform with open-source models. Production deployment data from Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks AI and Together AI shows significant cost improvements across healthcare, gaming, agentic chat, and customer service as enterprises scale AI from pilot projects to millions of users.\nThe 4x to 10x cost reductions reported by inference providers required combining Blackwell hardware with two other elements: optimized software stacks and switching from proprietary to open-source models that now match frontier-level intelligence. Hardware improvements alone delivered 2x gains in some deployments, according to the analysis. Reaching larger cost reductions required adopting low-precision formats like NVFP4 and moving away from closed source APIs that charge premium rates.\nThe economics prove counterintuitive. Reducing inference costs requires investing in higher-performance infrastructure because throughput improvements translate directly into lower per-token costs.\n\"Performance is what drives down the cost of inference,\" Dion Harris, senior director of HPC and AI hyperscaler solutions at Nvidia, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"What we're seeing in inference is that throughput literally translates into real dollar value and driving down the cost.\"\nProduction deployments show 4x to 10x cost reductions\nNvidia detailed four customer deployments in a blog post showing how the combination of Blackwell infrastructure, optimized software stacks and open-source models delivers cost reductions across different industry workloads. The case studies span high-volume applications where inference economics directly determines business viability.\nSully.ai cut healthcare AI inference costs by 90% (a 10x reduction) while improving response times 65% by switching from proprietary models to open-source models running on Baseten's Blackwell-powered platform, according to Nvidia. The company returned over 30 million minutes to physicians by automating medical coding and note-taking tasks that previously required manual data entry.\nNvidia also reported that Latitude reduced gaming inference costs 4x for its AI Dungeon platform by running large mixture-of-experts (MoE) models on DeepInfra's Blackwell deployment. Cost per million tokens dropped from 20 cents on Nvidia's previous Hopper platform to 10 cents on Blackwell, then to 5 cents after adopting Blackwell's native NVFP4 low-precision format. Hardware alone delivered 2x improvement, but reaching 4x required the precision format change.\nSentient Foundation achieved 25% to 50% better cost efficiency for its agentic chat platform using Fireworks AI's Blackwell-optimized inference stack, according to Nvidia. The platform orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows and processed 5.6 million queries in a single week during its viral launch while maintaining low latency.\nNvidia said Decagon saw 6x cost reduction per query for AI-powered voice customer support by running its multimodel stack on Together AI's Blackwell infrastructure. Response times stayed under 400 milliseconds, even when processing thousands of tokens per query, critical for voice interactions where delays cause users to hang up or lose trust.\nTechnical factors driving 4x versus 10x improvements\nThe range from 4x to 10x cost reductions across deployments reflects different combinations of technical optimizations rather than just hardware differences. Three factors emerge as primary drivers: precision format adoption, model architecture choices, and software stack integration.\nPrecision formats show the clearest impact. Latitude's case demonstrates this directly. Moving from Hopper to Blackwell delivered 2x cost reduction through hardware improvements. Adopting NVFP4, Blackwell's native low-precision format, doubled that improvement to 4x total. NVFP4 reduces the number of bits required to represent model weights and activations, allowing more computation per GPU cycle while maintaining accuracy. The format works particularly well for MoE models where only a subset of the model activates for each inference request.\nModel architecture matters. MoE models, which activate different specialized sub-models based on input, benefit from Blackwell's NVLink fabric that enables rapid communication between experts. \"Having those experts communicate across that NVLink fabric allows you to reason very quickly,\" Harris said. Dense models that activate all parameters for every inference don't leverage this architecture as effectively.\nSoftware stack integration creates additional performance deltas. Harris said that Nvidia's co-design approach — where Blackwell hardware, NVL72 scale-up architecture, and software like Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM are optimized together — also makes a difference. Baseten's deployment for Sully.ai used this integrated stack, combining NVFP4, TensorRT-LLM and Dynamo to achieve the 10x cost reduction. Providers running alternative frameworks like vLLM may see lower gains.\nWorkload characteristics matter. Reasoning models show particular advantages on Blackwell because they generate significantly more tokens to reach better answers. The platform's ability to process these extended token sequences efficiently through disaggregated serving, where context prefill and token generation are handled separately, makes reasoning workloads cost-effective.\nTeams evaluating potential cost reductions should examine their workload profiles against these factors. High token generation workloads using mixture-of-experts models with the integrated Blackwell software stack will approach the 10x range. Lower token volumes using dense models on alternative frameworks will land closer to 4x. \nWhat teams should test before migrating\nWhile these case studies focus on Nvidia Blackwell deployments, enterprises have multiple paths to reducing inference costs. AMD's MI300 series, Google TPUs, and specialized inference accelerators from Groq and Cerebras offer alternative architectures. Cloud providers also continue optimizing their inference services. The question isn't whether Blackwell is the only option but whether the specific combination of hardware, software and models fits particular workload requirements.\nEnterprises considering Blackwell-based inference should start by calculating whether their workloads justify infrastructure changes. \n\"Enterprises need to work back from their workloads and use case and cost constraints,\" Shruti Koparkar, AI product marketing at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.\nThe deployments achieving 6x to 10x improvements all involved high-volume, latency-sensitive applications processing millions of requests monthly. Teams running lower volumes or applications with latency budgets exceeding one second should explore software optimization or model switching before considering infrastructure upgrades.\nTesting matters more than provider specifications. Koparkar emphasizes that providers publish throughput and latency metrics, but these represent ideal conditions. \n\"If it's a highly latency-sensitive workload, they might want to test a couple of providers and see who meets the minimum they need while keeping the cost down,\" she said. Teams should run actual production workloads across multiple Blackwell providers to measure real performance under their specific usage patterns and traffic spikes rather than relying on published benchmarks.\nThe staged approach Latitude used provides a model for evaluation. The company first moved to Blackwell hardware and measured 2x improvement, then adopted NVFP4 format to reach 4x total reduction. Teams currently on Hopper or other infrastructure can test whether precision format changes and software optimization on existing hardware capture meaningful savings before committing to full infrastructure migrations. Running open source models on current infrastructure might deliver half the potential cost reduction without new hardware investments.\nProvider selection requires understanding software stack differences. While multiple providers offer Blackwell infrastructure, their software implementations vary. Some run Nvidia's integrated stack using Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM, while others use frameworks like vLLM. Harris acknowledges performance deltas exist between these configurations. Teams should evaluate what each provider actually runs and how it matches their workload requirements rather than assuming all Blackwell deployments perform identically.\nThe economic equation extends beyond cost per token. Specialized inference providers like Baseten, DeepInfra, Fireworks and Together offer optimized deployments but require managing additional vendor relationships. Managed services from AWS, Azure or Google Cloud may have higher per-token costs but lower operational complexity. Teams should calculate total cost including operational overhead, not just inference pricing, to determine which approach delivers better economics for their specific situation.",
