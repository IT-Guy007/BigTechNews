      "description": "OpenAI on Thursday launched GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a stripped-down coding model engineered for near-instantaneous response times, marking the company's first significant inference partnership outside its traditional Nvidia-dominated infrastructure. The model runs on hardware from Cerebras Systems, a Sunnyvale-based chipmaker whose wafer-scale processors specialize in low-latency AI workloads.\nThe partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. The company finds itself navigating a frayed relationship with longtime chip supplier Nvidia, mounting criticism over its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT, a newly announced Pentagon contract, and internal organizational upheaval that has seen a safety-focused team disbanded and at least one researcher resign in protest.\n\"GPUs remain foundational across our training and inference pipelines and deliver the most cost effective tokens for broad usage,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"Cerebras complements that foundation by excelling at workflows that demand extremely low latency, tightening the end-to-end loop so use cases such as real-time coding in Codex feel more responsive as you iterate.\"\nThe careful framing — emphasizing that GPUs \"remain foundational\" while positioning Cerebras as a \"complement\" — underscores the delicate balance OpenAI must strike as it diversifies its chip suppliers without alienating Nvidia, the dominant force in AI accelerators.\nSpeed gains come with capability tradeoffs that OpenAI says developers will accept\nCodex-Spark represents OpenAI's first model purpose-built for real-time coding collaboration. The company claims the model delivers more than 1000 tokens per second when served on ultra-low latency hardware, though it declined to provide specific latency metrics such as time-to-first-token figures.\n\"We aren't able to share specific latency numbers, however Codex-Spark is optimized to feel near-instant — delivering more than 1000 tokens per second while remaining highly capable for real-world coding tasks,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said.\nThe speed gains come with acknowledged capability tradeoffs. On SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 — two industry benchmarks that evaluate AI systems' ability to perform complex software engineering tasks autonomously — Codex-Spark underperforms the full GPT-5.3-Codex model. OpenAI positions this as an acceptable exchange: developers get responses fast enough to maintain creative flow, even if the underlying model cannot tackle the most sophisticated multi-step programming challenges.\nThe model launches with a 128,000-token context window and supports text only — no image or multimodal inputs. OpenAI has made it available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro subscribers through the Codex app, command-line interface, and Visual Studio Code extension. A small group of enterprise partners will receive API access to evaluate integration possibilities.\n\"We are making Codex-Spark available in the API for a small set of design partners to understand how developers want to integrate Codex-Spark into their products,\" the spokesperson explained. \"We'll expand access over the coming weeks as we continue tuning our integration under real workloads.\"\nCerebras hardware eliminates bottlenecks that plague traditional GPU clusters\nThe technical architecture behind Codex-Spark tells a story about inference economics that increasingly matters as AI companies scale consumer-facing products. Cerebras's Wafer Scale Engine 3 — a single chip roughly the size of a dinner plate containing 4 trillion transistors — eliminates much of the communication overhead that occurs when AI workloads spread across clusters of smaller processors.\nFor training massive models, that distributed approach remains necessary and Nvidia's GPUs excel at it. But for inference — the process of generating responses to user queries — Cerebras argues its architecture can deliver results with dramatically lower latency. Sean Lie, Cerebras's CTO and co-founder, framed the partnership as an opportunity to reshape how developers interact with AI systems.\n\"What excites us most about GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is partnering with OpenAI and the developer community to discover what fast inference makes possible — new interaction patterns, new use cases, and a fundamentally different model experience,\" Lie said in a statement. \"This preview is just the beginning.\"\nOpenAI's infrastructure team did not limit its optimization work to the Cerebras hardware. The company announced latency improvements across its entire inference stack that benefit all Codex models regardless of underlying hardware, including persistent WebSocket connections and optimizations within the Responses API. The results: 80 percent reduction in overhead per client-server round trip, 30 percent reduction in per-token overhead, and 50 percent reduction in time-to-first-token.\nA $100 billion Nvidia megadeal has quietly fallen apart behind the scenes\nThe Cerebras partnership takes on additional significance given the increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. Last fall, when OpenAI announced its Stargate infrastructure initiative, Nvidia publicly committed to investing $100 billion to support OpenAI as it built out AI infrastructure. The announcement appeared to cement a strategic alliance between the world's most valuable AI company and its dominant chip supplier.\nFive months later, that megadeal has effectively stalled, according to multiple reports. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly denied tensions, telling reporters in late January that there is \"no drama\" and that Nvidia remains committed to participating in OpenAI's current funding round. But the relationship has cooled considerably, with friction stemming from multiple sources.\nOpenAI has aggressively pursued partnerships with alternative chip suppliers, including the Cerebras deal and separate agreements with AMD and Broadcom. From Nvidia's perspective, OpenAI may be using its influence to commoditize the very hardware that made its AI breakthroughs possible. From OpenAI's perspective, reducing dependence on a single supplier represents prudent business strategy.\n\"We will continue working with the ecosystem on evaluating the most price-performant chips across all use cases on an ongoing basis,\" OpenAI's spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"GPUs remain our priority for cost-sensitive and throughput-first use cases across research and inference.\" The statement reads as a careful effort to avoid antagonizing Nvidia while preserving flexibility — and reflects a broader reality that training frontier AI models still requires exactly the kind of massive parallel processing that Nvidia GPUs provide.\nDisbanded safety teams and researcher departures raise questions about OpenAI's priorities\nThe Codex-Spark launch comes as OpenAI navigates a series of internal challenges that have intensified scrutiny of the company's direction and values. Earlier this week, reports emerged that OpenAI disbanded its mission alignment team, a group established in September 2024 to promote the company's stated goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The team's seven members have been reassigned to other roles, with leader Joshua Achiam given a new title as OpenAI's \"chief futurist.\"\nOpenAI previously disbanded another safety-focused group, the superalignment team, in 2024. That team had concentrated on long-term existential risks from AI. The pattern of dissolving safety-oriented teams has drawn criticism from researchers who argue that OpenAI's commercial pressures are overwhelming its original non-profit mission.\nThe company also faces fallout from its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT. Researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned this week over what she described as the \"slippery slope\" of ad-supported AI, warning in a New York Times essay that ChatGPT's archive of intimate user conversations creates unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Anthropic seized on the controversy with a Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nSeparately, the company agreed to provide ChatGPT to the Pentagon through Genai.mil, a new Department of Defense program that requires OpenAI to permit \"all lawful uses\" without company-imposed restrictions — terms that Anthropic reportedly rejected. And reports emerged that Ryan Beiermeister, OpenAI's vice president of product policy who had expressed concerns about a planned explicit content feature, was terminated in January following a discrimination allegation she denies.\nOpenAI envisions AI coding assistants that juggle quick edits and complex autonomous tasks\nDespite the surrounding turbulence, OpenAI's technical roadmap for Codex suggests ambitious plans. The company envisions a coding assistant that seamlessly blends rapid-fire interactive editing with longer-running autonomous tasks — an AI that handles quick fixes while simultaneously orchestrating multiple agents working on more complex problems in the background.\n\"Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background, or fanning out tasks to many models in parallel when you want breadth and speed, so you don't have to choose a single mode up front,\" the OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat.\nThis vision would require not just faster inference but sophisticated task decomposition and coordination across models of varying sizes and capabilities. Codex-Spark establishes the low-latency foundation for the interactive portion of that experience; future releases will need to deliver the autonomous reasoning and multi-agent coordination that would make the full vision possible.\nFor now, Codex-Spark operates under separate rate limits from other OpenAI models, reflecting constrained Cerebras infrastructure capacity during the research preview. \"Because it runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate rate limit that may adjust based on demand during the research preview,\" the spokesperson noted. The limits are designed to be \"generous,\" with OpenAI monitoring usage patterns as it determines how to scale.\nThe real test is whether faster responses translate into better software\nThe Codex-Spark announcement arrives amid intense competition for AI-powered developer tools. Anthropic's Claude Cowork product triggered a selloff in traditional software stocks last week as investors considered whether AI assistants might displace conventional enterprise applications. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue investing heavily in AI coding capabilities integrated with their respective cloud platforms.\nOpenAI's Codex app has demonstrated rapid adoption since launching ten days ago, with more than one million downloads and weekly active users growing 60 percent week-over-week. More than 325,000 developers now actively use Codex across free and paid tiers. But the fundamental question facing OpenAI — and the broader AI industry — is whether speed improvements like those promised by Codex-Spark translate into meaningful productivity gains or merely create more pleasant experiences without changing outcomes.\nEarly evidence from AI coding tools suggests that faster responses encourage more iterative experimentation. Whether that experimentation produces better software remains contested among researchers and practitioners alike. What seems clear is that OpenAI views inference latency as a competitive frontier worth substantial investment, even as that investment takes it beyond its traditional Nvidia partnership into untested territory with alternative chip suppliers.\nThe Cerebras deal is a calculated bet that specialized hardware can unlock use cases that general-purpose GPUs cannot cost-effectively serve. For a company simultaneously battling competitors, managing strained supplier relationships, and weathering internal dissent over its commercial direction, it is also a reminder that in the AI race, standing still is not an option. OpenAI built its reputation by moving fast and breaking conventions. Now it must prove it can move even faster — without breaking itself.",

      "description": "OpenAI's GPT-4o may have survived its first brush with going offline, but it won't be as lucky this time. OpenAI has officially retired GPT-4o, the ChatGPT model that was seen as more conversational and notoriously sycophantic, on February 13. The news of GPT-4o's end was first announced in a post on the OpenAI website in January, but the discontinuation also included GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini from ChatGPT.\nIt's not the first time that OpenAI has delisted GPT-4o as an option for ChatGPT. In August, the AI giant sunsetted the GPT-4o model in favor of rolling out and prioritizing the latest GPT-5 model at the time. However, a wave of user complaints led OpenAI to restore access to GPT-4o but with no guarantee that it'll be around forever.\n\nThis time around, OpenAI doesn't seem very open to preserving access to GPT-4o, especially since it'll serve only a small portion of the user base. The company wrote on its website that \"the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1 percent of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day.\" On top of that, OpenAI is facing several wrongful death lawsuits that specifically mention the GPT-4o model. Despite the two weeks of notice before GPT-4o's last day online, there is still a vocal group of users mourning the loss of their AI boyfriends and even calling for OpenAI to open-source their preferred model.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-has-officially-retired-the-controversial-gpt-4o-model-181553067.html?src=rss",

The results: 80 percent reduction in overhead per client-server round trip, 30 percent reduction in per-token overhead, and 50 percent reduction in time-to-first-token.\nA $100 billion Nvidia megadeal has quietly fallen apart behind the scenes\nThe Cerebras partnership takes on additional significance given the increasingly complicated relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia. Last fall, when OpenAI announced its Stargate infrastructure initiative, Nvidia publicly committed to investing $100 billion to support OpenAI as it built out AI infrastructure. The announcement appeared to cement a strategic alliance between the world's most valuable AI company and its dominant chip supplier.\nFive months later, that megadeal has effectively stalled, according to multiple reports. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly denied tensions, telling reporters in late January that there is \"no drama\" and that Nvidia remains committed to participating in OpenAI's current funding round. But the relationship has cooled considerably, with friction stemming from multiple sources.\nOpenAI has aggressively pursued partnerships with alternative chip suppliers, including the Cerebras deal and separate agreements with AMD and Broadcom. From Nvidia's perspective, OpenAI may be using its influence to commoditize the very hardware that made its AI breakthroughs possible. From OpenAI's perspective, reducing dependence on a single supplier represents prudent business strategy.\n\"We will continue working with the ecosystem on evaluating the most price-performant chips across all use cases on an ongoing basis,\" OpenAI's spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"GPUs remain our priority for cost-sensitive and throughput-first use cases across research and inference.\" The statement reads as a careful effort to avoid antagonizing Nvidia while preserving flexibility — and reflects a broader reality that training frontier AI models still requires exactly the kind of massive parallel processing that Nvidia GPUs provide.\nDisbanded safety teams and researcher departures raise questions about OpenAI's priorities\nThe Codex-Spark launch comes as OpenAI navigates a series of internal challenges that have intensified scrutiny of the company's direction and values. Earlier this week, reports emerged that OpenAI disbanded its mission alignment team, a group established in September 2024 to promote the company's stated goal of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The team's seven members have been reassigned to other roles, with leader Joshua Achiam given a new title as OpenAI's \"chief futurist.\"\nOpenAI previously disbanded another safety-focused group, the superalignment team, in 2024. That team had concentrated on long-term existential risks from AI. The pattern of dissolving safety-oriented teams has drawn criticism from researchers who argue that OpenAI's commercial pressures are overwhelming its original non-profit mission.\nThe company also faces fallout from its decision to introduce advertisements into ChatGPT. Researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned this week over what she described as the \"slippery slope\" of ad-supported AI, warning in a New York Times essay that ChatGPT's archive of intimate user conversations creates unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Anthropic seized on the controversy with a Super Bowl advertising campaign featuring the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nSeparately, the company agreed to provide ChatGPT to the Pentagon through Genai.mil, a new Department of Defense program that requires OpenAI to permit \"all lawful uses\" without company-imposed restrictions — terms that Anthropic reportedly rejected. And reports emerged that Ryan Beiermeister, OpenAI's vice president of product policy who had expressed concerns about a planned explicit content feature, was terminated in January following a discrimination allegation she denies.\nOpenAI envisions AI coding assistants that juggle quick edits and complex autonomous tasks\nDespite the surrounding turbulence, OpenAI's technical roadmap for Codex suggests ambitious plans. The company envisions a coding assistant that seamlessly blends rapid-fire interactive editing with longer-running autonomous tasks — an AI that handles quick fixes while simultaneously orchestrating multiple agents working on more complex problems in the background.\n\"Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background, or fanning out tasks to many models in parallel when you want breadth and speed, so you don't have to choose a single mode up front,\" the OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat.\nThis vision would require not just faster inference but sophisticated task decomposition and coordination across models of varying sizes and capabilities. Codex-Spark establishes the low-latency foundation for the interactive portion of that experience; future releases will need to deliver the autonomous reasoning and multi-agent coordination that would make the full vision possible.\nFor now, Codex-Spark operates under separate rate limits from other OpenAI models, reflecting constrained Cerebras infrastructure capacity during the research preview. \"Because it runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate rate limit that may adjust based on demand during the research preview,\" the spokesperson noted. The limits are designed to be \"generous,\" with OpenAI monitoring usage patterns as it determines how to scale.\nThe real test is whether faster responses translate into better software\nThe Codex-Spark announcement arrives amid intense competition for AI-powered developer tools. Anthropic's Claude Cowork product triggered a selloff in traditional software stocks last week as investors considered whether AI assistants might displace conventional enterprise applications. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon continue investing heavily in AI coding capabilities integrated with their respective cloud platforms.\nOpenAI's Codex app has demonstrated rapid adoption since launching ten days ago, with more than one million downloads and weekly active users growing 60 percent week-over-week. More than 325,000 developers now actively use Codex across free and paid tiers. But the fundamental question facing OpenAI — and the broader AI industry — is whether speed improvements like those promised by Codex-Spark translate into meaningful productivity gains or merely create more pleasant experiences without changing outcomes.\nEarly evidence from AI coding tools suggests that faster responses encourage more iterative experimentation. Whether that experimentation produces better software remains contested among researchers and practitioners alike. What seems clear is that OpenAI views inference latency as a competitive frontier worth substantial investment, even as that investment takes it beyond its traditional Nvidia partnership into untested territory with alternative chip suppliers.\nThe Cerebras deal is a calculated bet that specialized hardware can unlock use cases that general-purpose GPUs cannot cost-effectively serve. For a company simultaneously battling competitors, managing strained supplier relationships, and weathering internal dissent over its commercial direction, it is also a reminder that in the AI race, standing still is not an option. OpenAI built its reputation by moving fast and breaking conventions. Now it must prove it can move even faster — without breaking itself.",

        "description": "OpenAI's GPT-4o may have survived its first brush with going offline, but it won't be as lucky this time. OpenAI has officially retired GPT-4o, the ChatGPT model that was seen as more conversational and notoriously sycophantic, on February 13. The news of GPT-4o's end was first announced in a post on the OpenAI website in January, but the discontinuation also included GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini from ChatGPT.\nIt's not the first time that OpenAI has delisted GPT-4o as an option for ChatGPT. In August, the AI giant sunsetted the GPT-4o model in favor of rolling out and prioritizing the latest GPT-5 model at the time. However, a wave of user complaints led OpenAI to restore access to GPT-4o but with no guarantee that it'll be around forever.\n\nThis time around, OpenAI doesn't seem very open to preserving access to GPT-4o, especially since it'll serve only a small portion of the user base. The company wrote on its website that \"the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1 percent of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day.\" On top of that, OpenAI is facing several wrongful death lawsuits that specifically mention the GPT-4o model. Despite the two weeks of notice before GPT-4o's last day online, there is still a vocal group of users mourning the loss of their AI boyfriends and even calling for OpenAI to open-source their preferred model.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-has-officially-retired-the-controversial-gpt-4o-model-181553067.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/meta-facial-recognition-smart-glasses/",
        "description": "Meta plans to add a facial recognition feature to its Ray-Ban smart glasses as soon as this year, reports The New York Times ($). \r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to people involved in the plans who spoke to the publication, the feature is internally called \"Name Tag,\" and would let wearers identify people and get information about them via Meta's artificial intelligence assistant. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants the feature to differentiate the devices and to make the AI assistant in the glasses more useful.\r\n\r\nNYT, Facebook's parent company has been in discussions since early last year about releasing the feature, which carries obvious civil liberty and privacy risks. Based on the document, dated to last May, the company originally planned to release Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the blind – which did not happen – before releasing it to the general public. \r\n\r\nNYT quoting from the document out of Meta's Reality Labs:\r\n\r\n\"We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns.\"\nThe plan is a turnaround for the company – five years ago, Facebook shut down its facial recognition system for tagging people in photos on its social network, citing a need to find \"the right balance\" for a technology that raises privacy and legal concerns.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the first time it has considered adding facial recognition to a consumer product either. Technical challenges and ethical concerns reportedly prevented the feature from making it into Meta's first version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have proven successful since they debuted in 2021. EssilorLuxottica, which works with Meta to make the glasses, said this week that it sold more than seven million units in 2025.\r\n\r\nMeta is still said to be exploring who should be recognizable through the technology. Possible options reportedly include recognizing people a user knows via a Meta platform, and identifying people whom they may not know but who have a public account on a Meta site like Instagram. What Name Tag reportedly won't allow users to do is look up literally anyone they encounter.\r\n\r\nNYT, Meta said:\r\n\"We're building products that help millions of people connect and enrich their lives. While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature – and some products already exist in the market – we're still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out.\"\nMeta's smart glasses have already been used to identify people in public. In 2024, two Harvard students used Ray-Ban Meta glasses alongside the facial recognition service PimEyes to identify strangers on the Boston subway, and later posted a video of the experiment that went viral. Meta responded by emphasizing that the glasses included a small white LED on the top-right corner of the frame to signal when recording is taking place.\r\n\r\nMeta is apparently also working on so-called \"super-sensing\" glasses that continually run cameras and sensors to keep a record of someone's day.\r\n\r\nBloomberg report last year, Apple is planning to launch a set of smart glasses by the end of this year. The glasses will be comparable to Meta's Ray-Bans and Google's Android XR glasses, \"but better made.\" \r\n\r\nTags: Apple Smart Glasses, Meta\nThis article, \"Meta Plans 'Name Tag' Facial Recognition for Ray-Ban Smart Glasses\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/nvidias-new-technique-cuts-llm-reasoning-costs-by-8x-without-losing-accuracy",
        "description": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a technique that can reduce the memory costs of large language model reasoning by up to eight times. Their technique, called dynamic memory sparsification (DMS), compresses the key value (KV) cache, the temporary memory LLMs generate and store as they process prompts and reason through problems and documents.\nWhile researchers have proposed various methods to compress this cache before, most struggle to do so without degrading the model's intelligence. Nvidia's approach manages to discard much of the cache while maintaining (and in some cases improving) the model's reasoning capabilities.\nExperiments show that DMS enables LLMs to \"think\" longer and explore more solutions without the usual penalty in speed or memory costs.\nThe bottleneck of reasoning\nLLMs improve their performance on complex tasks by generating \"chain-of-thought\" tokens, essentially writing out their reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Inference-time scaling techniques leverage this by giving the model a larger budget to generate these thinking tokens or to explore multiple potential reasoning paths in parallel.\nHowever, this improved reasoning comes with a significant computational cost. As the model generates more tokens, it builds up a KV cache. \nFor real-world applications, the KV cache is a major bottleneck. As the reasoning chain grows, the cache grows linearly, consuming vast amounts of memory on GPUs. This forces the hardware to spend more time reading data from memory than actually computing, which slows down generation and increases latency. It also caps the number of users a system can serve simultaneously, as running out of VRAM causes the system to crash or slow to a crawl.\nNvidia researchers frame this not just as a technical hurdle, but as a fundamental economic one for the enterprise.\n\"The question isn't just about hardware quantity; it's about whether your infrastructure is processing 100 reasoning threads or 800 threads for the same cost,\" Piotr Nawrot, Senior Deep Learning Engineer at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.\nPrevious attempts to solve this focused on heuristics-based approaches. These methods use rigid rules, such as a \"sliding window\" that only caches the most recent tokens and deletes the rest. While this reduces memory usage, it often forces the model to discard critical information required for solving the problem, degrading the accuracy of the output.\n\"Standard eviction methods attempt to select old and unused tokens for eviction using heuristics,\" the researchers said. \"They simplify the problem, hoping that if they approximate the model's internal mechanics, the answer will remain correct.\"\nOther solutions use paging to offload the unused parts of the KV cache to slower memory, but the constant swapping of data introduces latency overhead that makes real-time applications sluggish.\nDynamic memory sparsification\nDMS takes a different approach by \"retrofitting\" existing LLMs to intelligently manage their own memory. Rather than applying a fixed rule for what to delete, DMS trains the model to identify which tokens are essential for future reasoning and which are disposable.\n\"It doesn't just guess importance; it learns a policy that explicitly preserves the model's final output distribution,\" Nawrot said.\nThe process transforms a standard, pre-trained LLM such as Llama 3 or Qwen 3 into a self-compressing model. Crucially, this does not require training the model from scratch, which would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, DMS repurposes existing neurons within the model’s attention layers to output a \"keep\" or \"evict\" signal for each token.\nFor teams worried about the complexity of retrofitting, the researchers noted that the process is designed to be lightweight. \"To improve the efficiency of this process, the model's weights can be frozen, which makes the process similar to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),\" Nawrot said. This means a standard enterprise model like Qwen3-8B \"can be retrofitted with DMS within hours on a single DGX H100.\"\nOne of the important parts of DMS is a mechanism called \"delayed eviction.\" In standard sparsification, if a token is deemed unimportant, it is deleted immediately. This is risky because the model might need a split second to integrate that token's context into its current state.\nDMS mitigates this by flagging a token for eviction but keeping it accessible for a short window of time (e.g., a few hundred steps). This delay allows the model to \"extract\" any remaining necessary information from the token and merge it into the current context before the token is wiped from the KV cache.\n“The ‘delayed eviction’ mechanism is crucial because not all tokens are simply ‘important’ (keep forever) or ‘useless’ (delete immediately). Many fall in between — they carry some information, but not enough to justify occupying an entire slot in memory,” Nawrot said. “This is where the redundancy lies. By keeping these tokens in a local window for a short time before eviction, we allow the model to attend to them and redistribute their information into future tokens.”\nThe researchers found that this retrofitting process is highly efficient. They could equip a pre-trained LLM with DMS in just 1,000 training steps, a tiny fraction of the compute required for the original training. The resulting models use standard kernels and can drop directly into existing high-performance inference stacks without custom hardware or complex software rewriting.\nDMS in action\nTo validate the technique, the researchers applied DMS to several reasoning models, including the Qwen-R1 series (distilled from DeepSeek R1) and Llama 3.2, and tested them on difficult benchmarks like AIME 24 (math), GPQA Diamond (science), and LiveCodeBench (coding).\nThe results show that DMS effectively moves the Pareto frontier, the optimal trade-off between cost and performance. On the AIME 24 math benchmark, a Qwen-R1 32B model equipped with DMS achieved a score 12.0 points higher than a standard model when constrained to the same memory bandwidth budget. By compressing the cache, the model could afford to \"think\" much deeper and wider than the standard model could for the same memory and compute budget.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, DMS defied the common wisdom that compression hurts long-context understanding. In \"needle-in-a-haystack\" tests, which measure a model's ability to find a specific piece of information buried in a large document, DMS variants actually outperformed the standard models. By actively managing its memory rather than passively accumulating noise, the model maintained a cleaner, more useful context.\nFor enterprise infrastructure, the efficiency gains translate directly to throughput and hardware savings. Because the memory cache is significantly smaller, the GPU spends less time fetching data, reducing the wait time for users. In tests with the Qwen3-8B model, DMS matched the accuracy of the vanilla model while delivering up to 5x higher throughput. This means a single server can handle five times as many customer queries per second without a drop in quality.\nThe future of memory\nNvidia has released DMS as part of its Model Optimizer framework. Regarding how enterprises can get started with DMS, Nawrot emphasized that the barrier to entry is low. \"The 'minimum viable infrastructure' is standard Hugging Face pipelines — no custom CUDA kernels are required,\" Nawrot said, noting that the code is fully compatible with standard FlashAttention. \nLooking ahead, the team views DMS as part of a larger shift where memory management becomes a distinct, intelligent layer of the AI stack. Nawrot also confirmed that DMS is \"fully compatible\" with newer architectures like the Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) used in DeepSeek’s models, suggesting that combining these approaches could yield even greater efficiency gains.\nAs enterprises move from simple chatbots to complex agentic systems that require extended reasoning, the cost of inference is becoming a primary concern. Techniques like DMS provide a path to scale these capabilities sustainably.\n\"We’ve barely scratched the surface of what is possible,\" Nawrot said, \"and we expect inference-time scaling to further evolve.\"",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/nvidia-groq-and-the-limestone-race-to-real-time-ai-why-enterprises-win-or",
        "description": "​From miles away across the desert, the Great Pyramid looks like a perfect, smooth geometry — a sleek triangle pointing to the stars. Stand at the base, however, and the illusion of smoothness vanishes. You see massive, jagged blocks of limestone. It is not a slope; it is a staircase.\n​Remember this the next time you hear futurists talking about exponential growth.\n​Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore (Moore's Law) is famously quoted for saying in 1965 that the transistor count on a microchip would double every year. Another Intel executive, David House, later revised this statement to “compute power doubling every 18 months.\" For a while, Intel’s CPUs were the poster child of this law. That is, until the growth in CPU performance flattened out like a block of limestone.\n​If you zoom out, though, the next limestone block was already there — the growth in compute merely shifted from CPUs to the world of GPUs. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, played a long game and came out a strong winner, building his own stepping stones initially with gaming, then computer visioniand recently, generative AI.\n​The illusion of smooth growth\n​Technology growth is full of sprints and plateaus, and gen AI is not immune. The current wave is driven by transformer architecture. To quote Anthropic’s President and co-founder Dario Amodei: “The exponential continues until it doesn’t. And every year we’ve been like, ‘Well, this can’t possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential’ — and then every year it has.”\n​But just as the CPU plateaued and GPUs took the lead, we are seeing signs that LLM growth is shifting paradigms again. For example, late in 2024, DeepSeek surprised the world by training a world-class model on an impossibly small budget, in part by using the MoE technique.\n​Do you remember where you recently saw this technique mentioned? Nvidia’s Rubin press release: The technology includes “...the latest generations of Nvidia NVLink interconnect technology... to accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale MoE model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token.”\n​Jensen knows that achieving that coveted exponential growth in compute doesn’t come from pure brute force anymore. Sometimes you need to shift the architecture entirely to place the next stepping stone.\n​The latency crisis: Where Groq fits in\n​This long introduction brings us to Groq.\n​The biggest gains in AI reasoning capabilities in 2025 were driven by “inference time compute” — or, in lay terms, “letting the model think for a longer period of time.” But time is money. Consumers and businesses do not like waiting.\n​Groq comes into play here with its lightning-speed inference. If you bring together the architectural efficiency of models like DeepSeek and the sheer throughput of Groq, you get frontier intelligence at your fingertips. By executing inference faster, you can “out-reason” competitive models, offering a “smarter” system to customers without the penalty of lag.\n​From universal chip to inference optimization\n​For the last decade, the GPU has been the universal hammer for every AI nail. You use H100s to train the model; you use H100s (or trimmed-down versions) to run the model. But as models shift toward \"System 2\" thinking — where the AI reasons, self-corrects and iterates before answering — the computational workload changes.\n​Training requires massive parallel brute force. Inference, especially for reasoning models, requires faster sequential processing. It must generate tokens instantly to facilitate complex chains of thought without the user waiting minutes for an answer. ​Groq’s LPU (Language Processing Unit) architecture removes the memory bandwidth bottleneck that plagues GPUs during small-batch inference, delivering lightning-fast inference.\n​The engine for the next wave of growth\n​For the C-Suite, this potential convergence solves the \"thinking time\" latency crisis. Consider the expectations from AI agents: We want them to autonomously book flights, code entire apps and research legal precedent. To do this reliably, a model might need to generate 10,000 internal \"thought tokens\" to verify its own work before it outputs a single word to the user.\n\n​On a standard GPU: 10,000 thought tokens might take 20 to 40 seconds. The user gets bored and leaves.\n\n​On Groq: That same chain of thought happens in less than 2 seconds.\n\n​If Nvidia integrates Groq’s technology, they solve the \"waiting for the robot to think\" problem. They preserve the magic of AI. Just as they moved from rendering pixels (gaming) to rendering intelligence (gen AI), they would now move to rendering reasoning in real-time.\n​Furthermore, this creates a formidable software moat. Groq’s biggest hurdle has always been the software stack; Nvidia’s biggest asset is CUDA. If Nvidia wraps its ecosystem around Groq’s hardware, they effectively dig a moat so wide that competitors cannot cross it. They would offer the universal platform: The best environment to train and the most efficient environment to run (Groq/LPU).\nConsider what happens when you couple that raw inference power with a next-generation open source model (like the rumored DeepSeek 4): You get an offering that would rival today’s frontier models in cost, performance and speed. That opens up opportunities for Nvidia, from directly entering the inference business with its own cloud offering, to continuing to power a growing number of exponentially growing customers.\n​The next step on the pyramid\n​Returning to our opening metaphor: The \"exponential\" growth of AI is not a smooth line of raw FLOPs; it is a staircase of bottlenecks being smashed.\n\n​Block 1: We couldn't calculate fast enough. Solution: The GPU.\n\n​Block 2: We couldn't train deep enough. Solution: Transformer architecture.\n\n​Block 3: We can't \"think\" fast enough. Solution: Groq’s LPU.\n\n​Jensen Huang has never been afraid to cannibalize his own product lines to own the future. By validating Groq, Nvidia wouldn't just be buying a faster chip; they would be bringing next-generation intelligence to the masses.\nAndrew Filev, founder and CEO of Zencoder",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/google-chrome-ships-webmcp-in-early-preview-turning-every-website-into-a",
        "description": "When an AI agent visits a website, it’s essentially a tourist who doesn’t speak the local language. Whether built on LangChain, Claude Code, or the increasingly popular OpenClaw framework, the agent is reduced to guessing which buttons to press: scraping raw HTML, firing off screenshots to multimodal models, and burning through thousands of tokens just to figure out where a search bar is.\nThat era may be ending. Earlier this week, the Google Chrome team launched WebMCP — Web Model Context Protocol — as an early preview in Chrome 146 Canary. WebMCP, which was developed jointly by engineers at Google and Microsoft and incubated through the W3C's Web Machine Learning community group, is a proposed web standard that lets any website expose structured, callable tools directly to AI agents through a new browser API: navigator.modelContext.\nThe implications for enterprise IT are significant. Instead of building and maintaining separate back-end MCP servers in Python or Node.js to connect their web applications to AI platforms, development teams can now wrap their existing client-side JavaScript logic into agent-readable tools — without re-architecting a single page.\nAI agents are expensive, fragile tourists on the web\nThe cost and reliability issues with current approaches to web-agent (browser agents)  interaction are well understood by anyone who has deployed them at scale. The two dominant methods — visual screen-scraping and DOM parsing — both suffer from fundamental inefficiencies that directly affect enterprise budgets.\n\n\nWith screenshot-based approaches, agents pass images into multimodal models (like Claude and Gemini) and hope the model can identify not only what is on the screen, but where buttons, form fields, and interactive elements are located. Each image consumes thousands of tokens and can have a long latency. With DOM-based approaches, agents ingest raw HTML and JavaScript — a foreign language full of various tags, CSS rules, and structural markup that is irrelevant to the task at hand but still consumes context window space and inference cost.\nIn both cases, the agent is translating between what the website was designed for (human eyes) and what the model needs (structured data about available actions). A single product search that a human completes in seconds can require dozens of sequential agent interactions — clicking filters, scrolling pages, parsing results — each one an inference call that adds latency and cost.\nHow WebMCP works: Two APIs, one standard\nWebMCP proposes two complementary APIs that serve as a bridge between websites and AI agents.\nThe Declarative API handles standard actions that can be defined directly in existing HTML forms. For organizations with well-structured forms already in production, this pathway requires minimal additional work; by adding tool names and descriptions to existing form markup, developers can make those forms callable by agents. If your HTML forms are already clean and well-structured, you are probably already 80% of the way there.\nThe Imperative API handles more complex, dynamic interactions that require JavaScript execution. This is where developers define richer tool schemas — conceptually similar to the tool definitions sent to the OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoints, but running entirely client-side in the browser. Through the registerTool(), a website can expose functions like searchProducts(query, filters) or orderPrints(copies, page_size) with full parameter schemas and natural language descriptions.\nThe key insight is that a single tool call through WebMCP can replace what might have been dozens of browser-use interactions. An e-commerce site that registers a searchProducts tool lets the agent make one structured function call and receive structured JSON results, rather than having the agent click through filter dropdowns, scroll through paginated results, and screenshot each page.\nThe enterprise case: Cost, reliability, and the end of fragile scraping\nFor IT decision makers evaluating agentic AI deployments, WebMCP addresses three persistent pain points simultaneously.\nCost reduction is the most immediately quantifiable benefit. By replacing sequences of screenshot captures, multimodal inference calls, and iterative DOM parsing with single structured tool calls, organizations can expect significant reductions in token consumption. \nReliability improves because agents are no longer guessing about page structure. When a website explicitly publishes a tool contract — \"here are the functions I support, here are their parameters, here is what they return\" — the agent operates with certainty rather than inference. Failed interactions due to UI changes, dynamic content loading, or ambiguous element identification are largely eliminated for any interaction covered by a registered tool.\nDevelopment velocity accelerates because web teams can leverage their existing front-end JavaScript rather than standing up separate backend infrastructure. The specification emphasizes that any task a user can accomplish through a page's UI can be made into a tool by reusing much of the page's existing JavaScript code. Teams do not need to learn new server frameworks or maintain separate API surfaces for agent consumers.\nHuman-in-the-loop by design, not an afterthought\nA critical architectural decision separates WebMCP from the fully autonomous agent paradigm that has dominated recent headlines. The standard is explicitly designed around cooperative, human-in-the-loop workflows — not unsupervised automation.\nAccording to Khushal Sagar, a staff software engineer for Chrome, the WebMCP specification identifies three pillars that underpin this philosophy. \n\nContext: All the data agents need to understand what the user is doing, including content that is often not currently visible on screen. \n\nCapabilities: Actions the agent can take on the user's behalf, from answering questions to filling out forms. \n\nCoordination: Controlling the handoff between user and agent when the agent encounters situations it cannot resolve autonomously.\n\nThe specification's authors at Google and Microsoft illustrate this with a shopping scenario: a user named Maya asks her AI assistant to help find an eco-friendly dress for a wedding. The agent suggests vendors, opens a browser to a dress site, and discovers the page exposes WebMCP tools like getDresses() and showDresses().  When Maya's criteria go beyond the site's basic filters, the agent calls those tools to fetch product data, uses its own reasoning to filter for \"cocktail-attire appropriate,\" and then calls showDresses()to update the page with only the relevant results. It's a fluid loop of human taste and agent capability, exactly the kind of collaborative browsing that WebMCP is designed to enable.\nThis is not a headless browsing standard. The specification explicitly states that headless and fully autonomous scenarios are non-goals. For those use cases, the authors point to existing protocols like Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. WebMCP is about the browser — where the user is present, watching, and collaborating.\nNot a replacement for MCP, but a complement\nWebMCP is not a replacement for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, despite sharing a conceptual lineage and a portion of its name. It does not follow the JSON-RPC specification that MCP uses for client-server communication. Where MCP operates as a back-end protocol connecting AI platforms to service providers through hosted servers, WebMCP operates entirely client-side within the browser.\nThe relationship is complementary. A travel company might maintain a back-end MCP server for direct API integrations with AI platforms like ChatGPT or Claude, while simultaneously implementing WebMCP tools on its consumer-facing website so that browser-based agents can interact with its booking flow in the context of a user's active session. The two standards serve different interaction patterns without conflict.\nThe distinction matters for enterprise architects. Back-end MCP integrations are appropriate for service-to-service automation where no browser UI is needed. WebMCP is appropriate when the user is present and the interaction benefits from shared visual context — which describes the majority of consumer-facing web interactions that enterprises care about.\nWhat comes next: From flag to standard\nWebMCP is currently available in Chrome 146 Canary behind the \"WebMCP for testing\" flag at chrome://flags. Developers can join the Chrome Early Preview Program for access to documentation and demos. Other browsers have not yet announced implementation timelines, though Microsoft's active co-authorship of the specification suggests Edge support is likely.\nIndustry observers expect formal browser announcements by mid-to-late 2026, with Google Cloud Next and Google I/O as probable venues for broader rollout announcements. The specification is transitioning from community incubation within the W3C to a formal draft — a process that historically takes months but signals serious institutional commitment.\nThe comparison that Sagar has drawn is instructive: WebMCP aims to become the USB-C of AI agent interactions with the web. A single, standardized interface that any agent can plug into, replacing the current tangle of bespoke scraping strategies and fragile automation scripts.\nWhether that vision is realized depends on adoption — by both browser vendors and web developers. But with Google and Microsoft jointly shipping code, the W3C providing institutional scaffolding, and Chrome 146 already running the implementation behind a flag, WebMCP has cleared the most difficult hurdle any web standard faces: getting from proposal to working software.",

        "description": "Disney is going after another generative AI tool, accusing ByteDance and its recently released Seedance 2.0 of using its copyrighted material without permission. As first reported on by Axios, the Walt Disney Company sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, claiming the Chinese company developed its Seedance tool \"with a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.\"\nThe letter, which was obtained by Axios, included examples of Seedance videos featuring copyrighted Disney characters, including Spider-Man, Darth Vader, Peter Griffin and more. Even though ByteDance just released Seedance 2.0 on Thursday, it's already earned praise, but also indignation from Hollywood studios, when it comes to its AI-generating capabilities.\n\nWith the strong early momentum, Seedance has already found itself in hot water with one of the largest media companies in the world. However, it's not the first time that Disney has threatened legal action against an AI company, since Character.AI received a cease-and-desist letter for the same offense in September. A few months later, Disney even accused Google of copyright infringement when training its AI models. On the other hand, Disney partnered with OpenAI in a three-year licensing agreement that allows the AI giant to generate images and videos using that highly sought-after intellectual property.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-accuses-bytedance-of-virtual-smash-and-grab-when-using-copyrighted-works-to-train-its-ai-191116136.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple's USB-C Magic Mouse is back on sale for about $11 off its usual retail price of $79. At $68, that's a savings of 14 percent for one of Apple's best accessories from a company that does not often run sales.\n \nThe multi-touch mouse was first released in 2009 with a modest refresh released in 2015 and the addition of a USB-C port in 2024. The rechargeable mouse features gesture controls and automatically pairs with your Mac when connected via USB. The Magic Mouse can also be used with an iPad via Bluetooth, or with a Windows PC, though in that case, functionality would be limited.\n \nFamously, Jony Ive's design of the Magic Mouse sees its charge port on the underside of the body, rendering it unusable while charging. In 2024 there were rumors of a more comprehensive redesign coming but nothing has materialized since.\n \n\n \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-magic-mouse-is-down-to-68-right-now-152708925.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Meta has backed away from highly controversial facial recognition tech in its products and services before, but seemingly not so far that it isn’t willing to have another crack at it. A new report from The New York Times claims Mark Zuckerberg’s company wants to add facial recognition to its lineup of branded smart glasses at some point this year.\nThe NYT spoke to four anonymous people with knowledge of Meta’s plans, who told the publication that the feature is codenamed \"Name Tag\" internally. As you’d expect, it would let people wearing Meta-powered Oakley or Ray-Ban glasses identify people and \"get information about them\" using AI.\n\nSuch technology naturally carries huge privacy and ethical risks, which is reportedly why Meta was hesitant to unveil Name Tag at a conference for the blind last year. It also may have shelved plans to include facial recognition in the first version of its smart glasses, which launched in 2023.\nIn an internal memo from Meta’s Reality Labs viewed by the NYT, Meta said that the current political instability in the US presents a good opportunity for it to push ahead with its plans. \"We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,\" it said.\nWith the smart glasses market expected to become more competitive in the coming years, Meta seemingly believes facial recognition would give it an edge on rival products from the likes of OpenAI. As for how it would work, the company is considering its options. It could recognize people the wearer is already connected to via one of Meta’s apps, or potentially display information from public Instagram accounts. The NYT’s sources said that universal facial recognition, effectively allowing you to look up the identity of anyone you walked past, would not be possible.\nMeta shut down Facebook’s Face Recognition system, used when tagging people in photos, in 2021, following widespread public backlash over privacy concerns. Three years later, it brought it back, this time as a tool for Instagram and Facebook designed to detect scam ads that use the faces of celebrities and other public figures. Last year Meta rolled out the feature beyond the US, so Facebook and later Instagram users in the UK, Europe and South Korea could also use it on their accounts.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-reportedly-working-to-bring-facial-recognition-to-its-smart-glasses-144721330.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/minimaxs-new-open-m2-5-and-m2-5-lightning-near-state-of-the-art-while",
        "description": "Chinese AI startup MiniMax, headquartered in Shanghai, has sent shockwaves through the AI industry today with the release of its new M2.5 language model in two variants, which promise to make high-end artificial intelligence so cheap you might stop worrying about the bill entirely. \nIt was made open source on Hugging Face under a modified MIT License requiring that those using the model (or custom variants) for commercial purposes \"prominently display 'MiniMax M2.5' on the user interface of such product or service.\" \nBut that's almost beside the point given how cheap MiniMax is serving it through its API and those of partners.\nFor the last few years, using the world’s most powerful AI was like hiring an expensive consultant—it was brilliant, but you watched the clock (and the token count) constantly. M2.5 changes that math, dropping the cost of the frontier by as much as 95%.\n\nBy delivering performance that rivals the top-tier models from Google and Anthropic at a fraction of the cost,  particularly in agentic tool use for enterprise tasks, including creating Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, MiniMax is betting that the future isn't just about how smart a model is, but how often you can afford to use it.\nIndeed, to this end, MiniMax says it worked \"with senior professionals in fields such as finance, law, and social sciences\" to ensure the model could perform real work up to their specifications and standards.\nThis release matters because it signals a shift from AI as a \"chatbot\" to AI as a \"worker\". When intelligence becomes \"too cheap to meter,\" developers stop building simple Q&A tools and start building \"agents\"—software that can spend hours autonomously coding, researching, and organizing complex projects without breaking the bank.\nIn fact, MiniMax has already deployed this model into its own operations. Currently, 30% of all tasks at MiniMax HQ are completed by M2.5, and a staggering 80% of their newly committed code is generated by M2.5!\nAs the MiniMax team writes in their release blog post, \"we believe that M2.5 provides virtually limitless possibilities for the development and operation of agents in the economy.\"\nTechnology: sparse power and the CISPO breakthrough\nThe secret to M2.5’s efficiency lies in its Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than running all of its 230 billion parameters for every single word it generates, the model only \"activates\" 10 billion. This allows it to maintain the reasoning depth of a massive model while moving with the agility of a much smaller one.\nTo train this complex system, MiniMax developed a proprietary Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework called Forge. MiniMax engineer Olive Song stated on the ThursdAI podcast on YouTube that this technique was instrumental to scaling the performance even while using the relatively small number of parameters, and that the model was trained over a period of two months.\n\nForge is designed to help the model learn from \"real-world environments\" — essentially letting the AI practice coding and using tools in thousands of simulated workspaces. \n\"What we realized is that there's a lot of potential with a small model like this if we train reinforcement learning on it with a large amount of environments and agents,\" Song said. \"But it's not a very easy thing to do,\" adding that was what they spent \"a lot of time\" on.\nTo keep the model stable during this intense training, they used a mathematical approach called CISPO (Clipping Importance Sampling Policy Optimization) and shared the formula on their blog.\nThis formula ensures the model doesn't over-correct during training, allowing it to develop what MiniMax calls an \"Architect Mindset\". Instead of jumping straight into writing code, M2.5 has learned to proactively plan the structure, features, and interface of a project first.\nState-of-the-art (and near) benchmarks\nThe results of this architecture are reflected in the latest industry leaderboards. M2.5 hasn't just improved; it has vaulted into the top tier of coding models, approaching Anthropic's latest model, Claude Opus 4.6, released just a week ago, and showing that Chinese companies are now just days away from catching up to far better resourced (in terms of GPUs) U.S. labs.\nHere are some of the new MiniMax M2.5 benchmark highlights:\n\nSWE-Bench Verified: 80.2% — Matches Claude Opus 4.6 speeds\n\nBrowseComp: 76.3% — Industry-leading search & tool use.\n\nMulti-SWE-Bench: 51.3% — SOTA in multi-language coding\n\nBFCL (Tool Calling): 76.8% — High-precision agentic workflows.\n\nOn the ThursdAI podcast, host Alex Volkov pointed out that MiniMax M2.5 operates extremely quickly and therefore uses less tokens to complete tasks, on the order $0.15 per task compared to $3.00 for Claude Opus 4.6.\nBreaking the cost barrier\nMiniMax is offering two versions of the model through its API, both focused on high-volume production use:\n\nM2.5-Lightning: Optimized for speed, delivering 100 tokens per second. It costs $0.30 per 1M input tokens and $2.40 per 1M output tokens.\n\nStandard M2.5: Optimized for cost, running at 50 tokens per second. It costs half as much as the Lightning version ($0.15 per 1M input tokens / $1.20 per 1M output tokens).\n\nIn plain language: MiniMax claims you can run four \"agents\" (AI workers) continuously for an entire year for roughly $10,000. \nFor enterprise users, this pricing is roughly 1/10th to 1/20th the cost of competing proprietary models like GPT-5 or Claude 4.6 Opus.\n\n\nModel\n\nInput\n\nOutput\n\nTotal Cost\n\nSource\n\n\nQwen 3 Turbo\n\n$0.05\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.25\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\ndeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\ndeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)\n\n$0.28\n\n$0.42\n\n$0.70\n\nDeepSeek\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\nGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)\n\n$0.20\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.70\n\nxAI\n\n\nMiniMax M2.5\n\n$0.15\n\n$1.20\n\n$1.35\n\nMiniMax\n\n\nMiniMax M2.5-Lightning\n\n$0.30\n\n$2.40\n\n$2.70\n\nMiniMax\n\n\nGemini 3 Flash Preview\n\n$0.50\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.50\n\nGoogle\n\n\nKimi-k2.5\n\n$0.60\n\n$3.00\n\n$3.60\n\nMoonshot\n\n\nGLM-5\n\n$1.00\n\n$3.20\n\n$4.20\n\nZ.ai\n\n\nERNIE 5.0\n\n$0.85\n\n$3.40\n\n$4.25\n\nBaidu\n\n\nClaude Haiku 4.5\n\n$1.00\n\n$5.00\n\n$6.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nQwen3-Max (2026-01-23)\n\n$1.20\n\n$6.00\n\n$7.20\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)\n\n$2.00\n\n$12.00\n\n$14.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nGPT-5.2\n\n$1.75\n\n$14.00\n\n$15.75\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\n\n$3.00\n\n$15.00\n\n$18.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGemini 3 Pro (>200K)\n\n$4.00\n\n$18.00\n\n$22.00\n\nGoogle\n\n\nClaude Opus 4.6\n\n$5.00\n\n$25.00\n\n$30.00\n\nAnthropic\n\n\nGPT-5.2 Pro\n\n$21.00\n\n$168.00\n\n$189.00\n\nOpenAI\n\n\nStrategic implications for enterprises and leaders\nFor technical leaders, M2.5 represents more than just a cheaper API. It changes the operational playbook for enterprises right now.\nThe pressure to \"optimize\" prompts to save money is gone. You can now deploy high-context, high-reasoning models for routine tasks that were previously cost-prohibitive.\nThe 37% speed improvement in end-to-end task completion means the \"agentic\" pipelines valued by AI orchestrators — where models talk to other models — finally move fast enough for real-time user applications.\nIn addition, M2.5’s high scores in financial modeling (74.4% on MEWC) suggest it can handle the \"tacit knowledge\" of specialized industries like law and finance with minimal oversight.\nBecause M2.5 is positioned as an open-source model, organizations can potentially run intensive, automated code audits at a scale that was previously impossible without massive human intervention, all while maintaining better control over data privacy.\nMiniMax M2.5 is a signal that the frontier of AI is no longer just about who can build the biggest brain, but who can make that brain the most useful—and affordable—worker in the room.",

        "description": "Airbnb plans to double down on artificial intelligence to improve its user experience for both guests and hosts. During a fourth-quarter earnings call, Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky, said the company is building an \"AI-native experience\" aimed at helping guests book trips, assisting hosts with their listings, and running the company more efficiently. According to Chesky, there's an AI search tool to help guests book trips that's live for a small percentage of users right now.\nIn a shareholder letter posted on Airbnb's website, the company said it's conducting early testing with an AI-powered search that is \"focused on giving guests a more natural way to describe what they’re looking for, and ask questions about the listing and location.\" The letter added that the AI search tool will become \"a more comprehensive and intuitive search experience that extends through the trip,\" but the company didn't offer a definitive date on when it would be available to the public.\n\nWhile it may feel like Airbnb is late to incorporating AI into its ecosystem, it introduced an AI chatbot that handles customer service requests last year. While the AI agent is only available to users in North America currently, Airbnb said that it already handles a third of customer requests without the need for human intervention, as reported by TechCrunch. Chesky also said during the earnings call that the AI chatbot would tackle \"significantly more\" customer tickets a year from now and that it would roll out to the rest of the world.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/airbnb-is-testing-out-ai-search-with-a-small-percentage-of-users-203054011.html?src=rss",

This design will provide users with a large inner display for watching videos and gaming, and there will likely be multitasking functionality.

        "description": "Apple is still planning to launch the smarter, more capable version of Siri in 2026, the company told CNBC today. Apple's statement comes just a day after Bloomberg reported Apple is having issues with the updated version of ‌Siri‌, leading to potential delays of the feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of ‌Siri‌ in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that Siri wasn't ready and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it would launch its Siri update in 2026.\r\n\r\nBloomberg said the company was aiming to include Siri in iOS 26.4, an update planned for spring 2026. Bloomberg's latest report suggests the ‌Siri‌ functionality will not be ready in time to be included in iOS 26.4, so the new features could be pushed to iOS 26.5 or iOS 27.\r\n\r\nApple may miss its internal target for the 2026 ‌Siri‌ launch, but since the company never publicly gave timing beyond 2026, there's no actual delay yet. Apple has until December 2026 to launch ‌Siri‌ within the timeframe that it promised in summer of 2025.\r\n\r\nBack in June 2024, Apple previewed three new ‌Siri‌ features, including onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to do more in and between apps. Apple has since started working on additional ‌Siri‌ features like image generation and a tool for searching the web.\r\n\r\niOS 26 updates planned for 2026, and iOS 27 will launch in September 2026.\r\n\r\nCNBC with a statement because the company's stock dropped five percent today, both due to the ‌Siri‌ delay rumors and FTC scrutiny over Apple News.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26\nTag: Siri\nRelated Forum: iOS 26\nThis article, \"Apple Confirms Revamped Siri is Still Coming in 2026\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "If you've been wondering what's next for Netflix's Terminator Zero in the time since its first season, we finally have an update, and it's a bummer. Responding to a fan on social media, showrunner Mattson Tomlin said this weekend that the show has been canceled. Despite being generally well received, Tomlin noted that \"at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it.\"\n\nIt was cancelled. The critical and audience reception to it was tremendous, but at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it. I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in season’s 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is. https://t.co/Dh7G6gkBF7 pic.twitter.com/dqCSXHIytg\n— mattson tomlin (@mattsontomlin) February 13, 2026\nSeason one of Terminator Zero was released in August 2024 and focused on the events around Judgment Day — August 29, 1997, as established in Terminator 2 — and its aftermath, jumping forward to 2022, more than two decades into a war between humans and machines. In the post about the show's cancellation, Tomlin wrote, \"I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in season’s 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is.\"\nTomlin went on to praise the marketing team in additional replies for \"trying to really make the show work,\" as well as the hundreds of people who worked on the show. Offering a bit of insight, Tomlin wrote, \"Generally speaking, anime audiences skew younger. Terminator audiences skew older. Terminator Zero asked them to meet in the middle, and they didn’t in the way the corporation needed to justify the spend to continue. I’m extremely grateful to the people who have watched it.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/terminator-zero-showrunner-confirms-the-netflix-anime-has-been-canceled-after-one-season-211656840.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Killing Satoshi, an upcoming biopic about the elusive creator of Bitcoin, will reportedly rely heavily on artificial intelligence to generate locations and adjust actors' performances, Variety reports. The film was announced in 2025 as being directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, The Edge of Tomorrow) and starring Casey Affleck and Pete Davidson in undisclosed roles, but its connection to overhyped technology was previously understood to begin and end with cryptocurrency.\nAccording to a UK casting notice viewed by Variety, the producers of Killing Satoshi reserve the right to \"change, add to, take from, translate, reformat or reprocess” actors' performances, using \"generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and/or machine learning technologies.\" No digital replicas will be created of performers, but it sounds like plenty of other AI-driven tweaks are on the table. The production's use of AI will also extend to the setting of its shoots, per Variety's source. Killing Satoshi will be shot on a \"markerless performative capture stage\" and things like backgrounds and locations will be entirely generated by AI.\nYou guess is as good as mine as to why a film about blockchain technology needs to be filmed this way, but Doug Liman has been connected with plenty of unusual projects in the past, including a rumored Tom Cruise film that was supposed to film on the International Space Station. Killing Satoshi will be far less practical in comparison, and walking a much finer line of what's acceptable in the entertainment industry. \nA major sticking point in SAG-AFTRA's 2023 contract negotiations was guaranteeing protections for actors who could be replaced by AI. Equity, the union representing actors in the UK, is currently negotiating protections for members that are concerned that AI could be used to reproduce their likenesses and voices and let studios use them without their consent.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/bitcoin-biopic-starring-casey-affleck-to-use-ai-to-generate-locations-and-tweak-performances-210657775.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Every once in a while, a product comes along that sparks a bit of joy in our jaded hearts. This is what happened with the Kodak Charmera, a $30 tiny toy camera that was nearly impossible to get ahold of in the first couple of months after its release, selling out immediately over waves of blind box restocks. Despite the gimmick of it all, the Charmera was just too cute for some of us to resist, and we sprang when they finally started becoming more readily available. \nA few of us on the Engadget team have one now, and even with all of its shortcomings, we kind of love this thing. Here's what two of our writers think about it. \n\nLately, it feels like a chore to carry around a full-frame mirrorless camera. My Nikon definitely feels like the right tool to precisely capture a moment in time with fast autofocus and plenty of image resolution. Other times, that perfect moment is more casual, like catching up with friends over dim sum or killing time while you're snowed in at a cabin in Vermont. In these cases, there's no reason to carry around a hulking camera and lens to snap a flawless photo that I have to edit later. Instead, something light, discreet and playful feels like the right tool for the occasion.\n\n \nThat's where the Kodak Charmera comes in. It's a toy camera with a 35mm lens with a fixed f/2.4 aperture and a 1/4-inch sensor. In other words, the photos this thing takes are about equivalent to what you would get with a crappy flip phone from the 2000s that also plays Snake. \nKodak is clearly trying to wring out the longing for nostalgia within all of us, and has nailed it with the Charmera, which is even inspired by its old-school disposable Fling cameras. It's definitely not as good as the smartphone in your pocket, but there's something disarming about snapping a quick shot with a tiny block of plastic that's lighter than your keys.\nPlaying around with the Charmera for a few weeks gave me a healthy reminder that the sillier and more transient parts of life don't need the technical prowess of an expensive camera. Obviously, the Chamera produces photos of terrible quality at 1.6 megapixels and can't really capture anything fast-moving or in low light, but it's undeniably fun and hard to resist shooting with. And sometimes, you and your friends are just doing wildly unserious things and you want a camera that matches that energy. \n— Jackson Chen, Contributing Reporter\n\n\n \nEvery time I pull out the Kodak Charmera in public to snap a few pictures, I'm immediately met with a barrage of questions and squeals of delight from full-grown adults: \"What is that?\"; \"Is that a camera?\"; \"Does it really take pictures?\"; \"Can I see it?\" It is the kind of accessory that doubles as a conversation starter, an effect that's turned out to be as joyous as taking pictures with the camera itself. I've been trying really hard to spend less time on social media and my phone in general lately, and having a two-inch camera clipped to me has made for a pretty fun shift in how I document the day-to-day. \nAs the resurgence of compact digital cameras has shown us, a lot of people are yearning for a time of simpler tech — when we had personal devices that could do useful things, like take decent photos and connect us to our friends, but didn't consume our lives entirely. Companies like Camp Snap have shaped their entire brands around recapturing that magic, and some consumers have shown that they're willing to sacrifice in areas like image quality in exchange for a taste of it, too. The Kodak Charmera isn't the kind of product you go into purchasing with high expectations. It is clearly a toy that is only going to be capable of so much.  \n\n \nAs Jackson noted, the low-resolution 1,440  x 1,080 pictures look about on par with those you'd have taken on a flip phone 15 or 20 years ago. In the right lighting conditions with a clearly defined subject, they're not so bad. But selfies, portraits and nature photos will generally look washed out. It can record videos too — and you should set similarly low expectations for these. \nDespite all that, I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying the Charmera experience. Its crunchy photos are just good enough to feel like they're successfully preserving a moment in time. And being so tiny, it's really convenient to bring everywhere. It even came with me to CES. The Charmera takes a microSD card (sold separately), allowing for tons of storage and easy transferring. There are a bunch of built-in filters you can apply, too, which have been fun to play around with.\nIf I want high-quality photos, this isn't the camera I'm going to reach for. But it's great for low-stakes situations when all I care about is taking some pictures I can look back on fondly later. Consider me charmed. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-ridiculously-tiny-kodak-charmera-captured-our-hearts-and-lots-of-shoddy-pictures-140000245.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Volume two of the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection will arrive on August 27, publisher Konami announced today during Sony’s latest State of Play presentation. The bundle will feature 2008’s Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, the HD remaster of 2010’s Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and a selection of bonus content, including Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, which was originally released for Game Boy Color in 2000. All told, that’s a smaller selection of games than Konami made available with Vol. 1 of the Master Collection, but Metal Gear fans will be excited nonetheless, if only for the fact it will mark the first time MGS4 will be officially playable on a platform other than the PlayStation 3. \n\n\n\nThat it has taken Konami nearly two decades to release the conclusion of Solid Snake’s story on more systems has to do with the nature of the game as a PS3 exclusive. MGS4 took extensive advantage of the console’s unique Cell architecture, a fact that made it difficult (and expensive) proposition to port to more recent x86-based systems. In recent years, it’s been possible to emulate the game on a powerful PC, but not everyone has that kind of hardware.    \nMetal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2  will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.\nUpdate, February 12, 6:30PM ET: This story was updated after publish to add details about Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2’s launch platforms.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-next-metal-gear-solid-remaster-collection-arrives-this-summer-231711005.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-iwork-website-removed/",
        "description": "With the launch of the Creator Studio subscription app offering, Apple may be phasing out the iWork branding that it has used since 2005 for Pages, Keynote, and Numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple today removed the iWork section on its website, and the URL now redirects to a more generic \"apps\" page that features Creator Studio, Apple Arcade, Apple Invites, Image Playground, and other Apple apps.\r\n\r\nThe iWork page that Apple removed was dedicated solely to Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, featuring information on each app along with a link. Apple's apps page offers some of the same information in a dedicated productivity section, but with additional details on the premium features included in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote with Apple Creator Studio.\r\n\r\napps page does not mention the iWork branding at all, suggesting that Apple is no longer referring to the three productivity apps using that term and is instead going to advertise them as Apple Creator Studio apps.\r\n\r\nApple's now-removed iWork page\n\r\nIt's not clear if Apple is going to phase out \"iWork\" entirely, and the term is still used across different support documents and guides. It may take time to completely eliminate the all-in-one branding that Apple has used for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote for more than 20 years, or it could still be used in some limited situations.\r\n\r\nApple introduced Keynote as a standalone app in 2003, and added Pages in January 2004. A year later, both apps were bundled together under the iWork '05 name, with the software priced at $79. Apple said iWork was a successor to AppleWorks, an office suite that included a word processing app, a database, a drawing app, and a spreadsheet app. The iWork apps were designed from the ground up, and were essentially the Mac equivalent to Microsoft Office.\r\n\r\niCloud). When iWork '09 came out, Apple started selling the apps for $20 each, later adding them to the Mac App Store when it launched in 2011. iOS versions of the iWork apps came in 2010 with the launch of the first iPad, with Apple charging $9.99 each.\r\n\r\nApple redesigned the iWork apps for Mac and iOS in 2013, and started offering them for free to Mac buyers. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers remain free today, though there are now upgraded features accessible only through the Apple Creator Studio subscription.\r\n\r\npriced at $12.99 per month, and in addition to the iWork apps, it includes access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage. For Numbers, Pages, and Keynote, Apple Creator Studio adds a content hub with Apple-curated royalty-free photos, premium templates, and themes. There's also a tool to remix image creations right in a document, and a Super Resolution tool for upscaling images.\r\n\r\niBooks and iPhoto are now Apple Books and Photos, respectively, while iTunes has been separated into Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Podcasts. Apple still uses \"i\" branding for iMovie, ‌iCloud‌, iPhone, ‌iPad‌, and iMac. \nTag: iWork\nThis article, \"Is Apple Phasing Out the iWork Brand?\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

For example, there are articles and videos highlighting everything from reasons to upgrade to a newer iPhone to popular iPad features.\r\n\r\nApple is aiming to release the \"Sales Coach\" app on Monday, February 23, our source said. It will have two major changes compared to the \"SEED\" app, including an all-new Liquid Glass design, and later an AI chatbot that can provide Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees with sales tips and product information.\r\n\r\nWhen it arrives in a later update, the chatbot will be accessible from the \"Ask\" tab in the app, and employees will be able to ask it various Apple product knowledge questions. For example, they could ask about the iPhone Air's key features, or inquire about how the Instant Hotspot feature on the Mac works. We have not confirmed if the chatbot uses Apple's own large language model, or if it relies on a third-party platform.\r\n\r\nsalescoach.apple.com.

        "description": "Apple has shared updated iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 adoption figures, revealing how many iPhones and iPads are running those software versions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese adoption numbers are based on iPhones and iPads that transacted on the App Store on February 12, 2026, according to Apple.\r\n\r\n74% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years are running iOS 26.\n\r\n66% of all iPhones are running iOS 26.\n\r\n66% of all iPads introduced in the last four years are running iPadOS 26.\n\r\n57% of all iPads are running iPadOS 26.\nHere is how that compares to the iOS 18 adoption figures that Apple shared based on iPhones and iPads that transacted on the App Store on January 21, 2025:\n76% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years were running iOS 18.\n\r\n68% of all iPhones were running iOS 18.\n\r\n63% of all iPads introduced in the last four years were running iPadOS 18.\n\r\n53% of all iPads were running iPadOS 18.\nAt first glance, the iOS 26 and iOS 18 adoption figures appear to be similar, but this is only because Apple released the iOS 26 statistics later than usual. iOS 26's statistics are based on devices that transacted with the App Store approximately 150 days after the update was released to the public, compared to 127 days for iOS 18. In other words, iOS 26 was available for around three weeks longer by comparison.\r\n\r\nAs was suspected, this means that iOS 26 adoption has officially been slower than iOS 18 adoption, but not to the extent that some earlier, unofficial estimates had claimed. There is no way of knowing exactly why iOS 26 adoption has been slower, but some users have opted to avoid the new Liquid Glass design for now.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26\nRelated Forum: iOS 26\nThis article, \"Apple Reveals How Many iPhones Are Running iOS 26\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Apple released macOS Tahoe last September, but despite two point updates since then, it is still struggling to resolve an embarrassing interface issue in Finder that appears to have been introduced with its Liquid Glass redesign.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you updated your Mac to macOS Tahoe and you prefer to work in Finder's column view, there's a good chance you've been frustrated by the glitch, which developer Jeff Johnson has been admirably tracking over on his blog. \r\n\r\nScroll bar blocking column resize handles (Original image: Jeff Johnson)\n\r\nAt the bottom of each Finder column are handy little resize handles allowing you to expand or reduce each column as you see fit. But in macOS 26 and macOS 26.2, when scroll bars are set to \"always show,\" the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom overlaps and covers those handles, so you can't click them to adjust column widths the way you could in earlier macOS versions like Sequoia. \r\n\r\nScroll bar occluding column content (Original image: Jeff Johnson)\n\r\nWith the recent release of macOS 26.3, Apple attempted a fix. The vertical scrollers were shortened so the resizing widgets now sit above the horizontal bar and are technically clickable again. Unfortunately though, as Johnson points out, the horizontal scroll bar still overlaps file names in the view, causing it to regularly obscure content. Moreover, if you hide the path bar and status bar, the layout leaves a weird amount of empty space below the scrollers, making the whole thing look unfinished (see image below). \r\n\r\nColumn resize handles suspended in mid-air (Original image: Jeff Johnson)\n\r\nJohnson's take is basically that while the most disruptive bug is less bad now, the overall column view layout still feels half-baked – especially for anyone who keeps scroll bars always visible. \r\n\r\nDaring Fireball's John Gruber points out, it's an embarrassing fudge for a company that used to pride itself on pixel-perfect settings across its Mac operating system. \r\n\r\ndelayed, depending on who you believe. The update is also expected to introduce new emoji characters.\nThis article, \"macOS Tahoe Finder Bug Underscores Apple's Slipping UI Polish\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-live-activities-fix/",
        "description": "In watchOS 26, the Smart Stack for your Apple Watch is pretty clever. The collection of widgets can be pulled up with a scroll of the Digital Crown, and shows you relevant information throughout your day. But sometimes, its eagerness to help can be a bit much, especially when it comes to Live Activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're probably familiar with this scenario: You raise your wrist expecting to see your customized watch face, but it's been replaced by media playback controls because someone's watching your Apple TV, or a timer you set earlier for cooking that still has ages left to run. Live Activities in the Smart Stack can clearly be useful, but having them automatically take over your display isn't always ideal. Here's how to take back control:\r\n\r\n  \nOpen Settings on your Apple Watch.\n\r\n  \nTap Smart Stack.\n\r\n  \nSelect Live Activities.\n\r\n  \nToggle off the switch next to Auto-Launch Live Activities.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter disabling auto-launch, Live Activities will still be available in your Smart Stack when you want them – you'll just need to manually scroll to see them instead of having them pop up automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you want more granular control, you're in luck. From the same settings screen you can control which Apple apps display Live Activities. Using the Watch app on your iPhone, you can also manage Live Activities settings for third-party apps. This lets you keep the notifications you find useful while preventing the less important ones from interrupting your watch face.\r\n\r\nMedia Apps in the same settings menu and turn off Live Activities completely, or alternatively under \"Auto-Launch,\" select Off or Smart Stack for a more focused watch face experience.\nThis article, \"Live Activities Taking Over Your Apple Watch?

        "description": "Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls was first announced last year as a tag fighting game feature superheroes including Captain America, Ms Marvel and Spider-Man, with a launch sometime in 2026. We expected more details to be revealed at Sony's State of Play yesterday and indeed they were. The game will arrive August 6 on PS5 and PC and include the Unbreakable X-Men's Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger. \nThe trailer teases each character's fighting style, with Magik and Wolverine using a more in-your-face melee fighting style. Storm and Danger, meanwhile, offer more diverse attack abilities, with Storm manipulating wind and lightning and Magik deploying sorcery skills. We also saw a team-based finisher attack with all four characters joining forces to unleash a flurry of attacks. The trailer also revealed that Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls will offer an Episode Mode with a \"new form of storytelling adapted for a modern video game format\" that marries Manga with American comics. \n\nMARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls launches on August 6, 2026 for PS5 and PC. Pre-orders open February 19, 2026 at the PlayStation Store and PC storefronts. It will be sold in three versions: the $60 Standard Edition, $85 Digital Deluxe Edition (includes the full game, all pre-order incentives, a Year 1 Characters and Stage Pass) and Howard the Duck and Cosmo. Finally, the $100 Ultimate Edition includes all the preceding, plus costumes for Storm, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Iron Man, and Spider-Man, along with an Animated Chromatic color unlock for all 20 launch characters. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-lands-on-ps5-and-pc-august-6-with-x-men-in-tow-095235773.html?src=rss",

        "description": "We discuss the upcoming iPhone 17e and iPad models, as well as Apple's apparent issues finalizing the revamped version of Siri, on this week's episode of The MacRumors Show.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel for more videos\n\r\nThe announcement of the ‌iPhone‌ 17e is said to be \"imminent,\" with stock of the iPhone 16e now dwindling. The new device is rumored to come with four main new features, including the A19 chip from the iPhone 17, MagSafe connectivity, the C1X cellular modem, and the N1 chip for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Thread connectivity.\r\n\r\non the horizon for the near future. The eighth-generation iPad Air is expected to move to the M4 chip, while the 12th-generation ‌iPad‌ is expected to jump a chip generation up to the A18, which will also enable Apple Intelligence support for the first time on the device.\r\n\r\nrun into snags\" testing the personalized, smarter version of ‌Siri‌ originally planned for iOS 26.4. Due to the issues, the upcoming ‌Siri‌ features will likely be partially delayed and spread across several upcoming iOS releases. Apple could postpone some or all of the new ‌Siri‌ features until iOS 26.5, an update planned for May, and iOS 27, which will launch this September.\r\n\r\nwould take longer than expected, with the functionality delayed for a year.\r\n\r\ntargeting iOS 26.4, which the company will begin beta testing later this month, but there have apparently been unforeseen problems: ‌Siri‌ sometimes doesn't properly process queries and can take too long to respond to requests.\r\n\r\nApple engineers have been told to use iOS 26.5 for further internal testing, suggesting the new ‌Siri‌ features will be delayed until that update. Employees that are testing iOS 26.5 say the update includes all of the features Apple promised, including personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for ‌Siri‌ to do more in and between apps, but not all of the features are working reliably and there are problems with accuracy.\r\n\r\npartnered with Google to use, even when the new version of ‌Siri‌ is capable of handling a user's request.\r\n\r\nImage Playground or search the web. Image generation and web search were tested as part of iOS 26.4, and it's possible they will still be included in the update, so Apple might still be able to release some of the new ‌Siri‌ functionality. Bloomberg says the situation is \"fluid,\" though, so Apple's plans could change, and executives are reluctant to further delay the ‌Siri‌ functionality beyond spring 2026.\r\n\r\nThere are still major changes planned for ‌Siri‌ as part of iOS 27, with Apple aiming to add chatbot functionality to better compete with the likes of like Gemini and ChatGPT. This new version of ‌Siri‌ will also reportedly have deeper integration with apps and Apple's operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe MacRumors Show has its own YouTube channel, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r\n\r\n\nSubscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel!\n\n\r\n\r\nApple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, or other podcast apps.

        "link": "https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/879325/apple-airtag-1st-generation-presidents-day-sale-deal",
        "description": "The first-gen AirTag remains a good tracker, though remember you’ll need to buy a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\t\n\nWith Apple’s second-gen AirTags now widely available, we’re already seeing inventory of the first-gen model begin to dwindle. Case in point? Amazon is no longer selling a single AirTag, and it’s unclear when — or if — the retailer will restock the first-gen model. Thankfully, you can still grab a four-pack of the first-gen location trackers for around $64 ($35 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for Presidents Day, which is $2 shy of the bundle’s best price to date. If you just want one, you can also buy a single tracker at Walmart for $17 ($12 off).\nApple AirTag (first-gen)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $64 at Amazon (four-pack)\n $99 $64 at Walmart (four-pack) \n $99 $64.99 at Best Buy (four-pack)\n\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, you’d be hard-pressed to find another tracker that’s as precise or as helpful as Apple’s AirTag. That’s because, like the second-gen model, the original can tap into Apple’s vast Find My network and leverage ultra wideband (UWB) technology. As a result, all you need to do is open up the Find My app on your phone and follow the on-screen arrows, sounds, or vibrations, which will guide you to the exact location of your item, even if it’s slipped between your car seats. That’s a level of precision many rival trackers, notably Tile’s, lack.\nOn top of that, you also get access to a growing list of helpful software features. You can, for example, share an AirTag’s location with up to five people — which comes in handy for families while traveling — and you can even temporarily share an AirTag’s location with some airlines (including American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic). \nIn addition to the aforementioned software perks, Apple’s handy location trackers are designed to last. The battery can last up to a year, and when it dies, you just need to swap in a standard CR2032 cell instead of replacing the tracker entirely. Each AirTag also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand both dust and a little bit of rain. \nThere are some features you’ll miss out on if you go with the last-gen AirTag instead of the newer model, including an upgraded UWB chip that enables more precise location tracking. The second-gen version can also help you track items further away, and the speaker is 50 percent louder. But if you want to save some cash, the original is still one of the better trackers on the market and definitely worth picking up while you still can.\nRead our full AirTag (2021) review.",

        "description": "We're still waiting for Apple CarPlay compatibility for Tesla EVs, but it's been pushed back thanks to a slight hitch with iOS 26, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In the latest Power On newsletter, Gurman said that Tesla's plans to adopt CarPlay have been delayed due to app compatibility issues as well as low adoption rates for iOS 26.\nIt's been a long wait for Tesla drivers who want CarPlay compatibility, especially since initial rumors indicated a late 2025 rollout and Bloomberg reported that Tesla was testing CarPlay in its vehicles in November. However, Gurman's latest newsletter revealed that there were some compatibility issues between Apple Maps and Tesla's in-house navigation software, which also supports the self-driving features.\n\nTo address this, Apple released an iOS 26 update that would better synchronize the two navigation apps, especially when a driver would use Tesla's autonomous driving options. Still, Tesla is reportedly concerned enough about the low adoption rates of iOS 26 to delay delivering CarPlay to its vehicles. Gurman also noted that iOS 26 adoption rates were lower than usual, but are already going up, citing Apple's latest numbers that 74 percent of all iPhones released in the last four years are running iOS 26. \nThere's still no official date for when CarPlay arrives in Teslas, but including the beloved in-car feature could be a way to boost sales for the company. According to the January registration estimates in the US, Tesla saw sales slip for the fourth month in a row.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-carplay-is-coming-but-its-reportedly-being-held-back-by-low-ios-26-adoption-numbers-173812736.html?src=rss",

        "description": "A few days ago, a Redditor posted in the community for DoorDash drivers that they received an offer to close a Waymo vehicle’s door. The job paid a guaranteed fee of $6.25 with a $5 extra on top of it after the DoorDasher verifies that it has been completed. Waymo has confirmed to 404Media and TechCrunch that, yes, it is indeed paying Dashers to shut the doors of its self-driving cars. And it makes sense because, well, there’s nobody to do it otherwise if a passenger accidentally leaves it open. \nThe Alphabet subsidiary and DoorDash told the publications that it’s currently running a pilot program in Atlanta, wherein if one of its vehicle’s doors is left ajar, nearby Dashers are notified. Waymo’s self-driving vehicles can’t leave if one of its doors remains open, so the company is framing the program as a way to enhance its fleet’s efficiency. Waymo told 404Media that the program started earlier this year and that payments are structured to ensure “competitive and fair compensation for Dashers.”\nTo note, this isn’t the first time the two companies have teamed up. In October 2025, Waymo’s self-driving cars became a delivery option for DoorDash customers in Phoenix, Arizona. To get a Waymo delivery, customers will have to choose “opt in to autonomous delivery” during checkout and to physically retrieve their order from the car’s trunk when it arrives. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/doordashers-are-getting-paid-to-close-waymos-self-driving-car-doors-122711640.html?src=rss",

        "description": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly been asking tech companies for information on accounts posting anti-ICE sentiments. According to The New York Times, DHS has sent hundreds of administrative subpoenas to Google, Reddit, Discord and Meta over the past few months. Homeland Security asked the companies for names, email addresses, telephone numbers and any other identifying detail for accounts that have criticized the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or have reported the location of its agents. Google, Meta and Reddit have  complied with some of the requests\nAdministrative subpoenas are different from warrants and are issued by the DHS. The Times says they were rarely used in the past and were mostly sent to companies for the investigation of serious crimes, such as child trafficking. Apparently, though, the government has ramped up its use in the past year. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability,” Steve Loney, a senior supervising attorney for ACLU, told the publication. \nCompanies can choose whether to comply with the authorities or not, and some of them give the subject of a subpoena up to 14 days to fight it in court. Google told The Times that its review process for government requests is “ designed to protect user privacy while meeting [its] legal obligations” and that it informs users when their accounts have been subpoenaed unless it has been legally ordered not to or in exceptional circumstances. “We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company said. \nSome of the accounts that were subpoenaed belong to users posting ICE activity in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Facebook and Instagram in English and Spanish. The DHS asked Meta for their names and details on September 11, and the users were notified about it on October 3. They were told that if Meta didn’t receive documentation that they were fighting the subpoena in court within 10 days, Meta will give Homeland Security the information it was asking for. The ACLU filed a motion for the users in court, arguing that the DHS is using administrative subpoenas as a tool to suppress speech of people it didn’t agree with. \nIn late January, Meta started blocking links to ICE List, a website that lists thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents’ names. A few days ago, House Judiciary Committee member Jamie Raskin (D-MD) also asked Apple and Google to turn over all their communication with the US Department of Justice to investigate the removal of ICE-tracking apps from their respective app stores. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/homeland-security-has-reportedly-sent-out-hundreds-of-subpoenas-to-identify-ice-critics-online-135245457.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Meta went to court this week in two major trials over alleged harms facilitated by its platform. In New Mexico, the state's attorney general has accused the company of facilitating child exploitation and harming children through addictive features. In a separate case in Los Angeles, a California woman sued the company over mental health harms she says she suffered as the result of addictive design choices from Meta and others.\nIn both cases, Meta has disputed the idea that social media should be considered an \"addiction.\" On the stand this week, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that social media isn't \"clinically addictive,\" comparing it to being \"addicted\" to a Netflix show.\nIn opening statements in the New Mexico trial, Meta's lawyer Kevin Huff went further. He told the jury that \"social media addiction is not a thing\" because it's not in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook used by mental health professionals in the US.\n\"According to the American Psychiatric Association, they don't recognize the concept of social media addiction in the same way as addiction to drugs and alcohol,\" Huff said during opening arguments that were broadcast by Courtroom View Network. \"What you see on the screen is what's called the DSM, which is basically the official manual for recognized mental disorders. The American Psychiatric Association studied this and decided that social media addiction is not a thing.\"\nBut the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has never said that social media addiction doesn't exist. The organization provides information and resources about social media addiction on its website. \"Social media addiction is not currently listed as a diagnosis in the DSM-5-TR—but that does not mean it doesn’t exist,\" the APA said in a statement to Engadget.\nDr. Tania Moretta, a clinical pyschophysiology researcher who has studied social media addiction, agrees. \"The absence of a DSM classification does not mean that a behavior cannot be addictive, maladaptive or clinically significant,\" she told Engadget. That argument, she said, \"reflects a misunderstanding\" of how psychiatry professionals define and classify conditions. \"Diagnostic manuals formalize scientific consensus; they do not define the boundaries of legitimate scientific inquiry. Many maladaptive behaviors and clinically significant symptom patterns are studied and treated well before receiving official classification.\"\nMeta's critics have long claimed that the company has profited from addictive features that hook children and teens. The trials in Los Angeles and New Mexico are just the start of several court battles over the issue. The social media company is also facing a high-profile trial with school districts in June, and lawsuits from 41 state attorneys general. \nMoretta said that social media addiction is a field that requires more study, but that there is already evidence that it can have harmful effects on some people. \"At present, from a scientific perspective, there is documented evidence that social media use disorder is associated with both psychophysiological alterations, including changes in reward/motivational and inhibitory/regulatory systems, and clinically significant negative impacts on functioning (e.g., sleep disturbances, psychological distress, impairment in social, academic, or occupational domains),\" she said. \"The key question is not whether all social media use is addictive, but whether a subset of users exhibits patterns consistent with behavioral addiction models and whether specific platform design features may exacerbate vulnerability in predisposed individuals.\"\nBoth trials are ongoing and expected to last the next several weeks. In New Mexico, jurors have already heard from former employee turned whistleblower Arturo Bejar and former exec Brian Boland, both of whom have publicly criticized the company for not prioritizing safety. In Los Angeles, Mosseri's testimony has wrapped up, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify next week. The trials will also feature extensive internal documents from Meta, including details about the company's own research into the mental health impacts of its platform on young people.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-really-wants-you-to-believe-social-media-addiction-is-not-a-real-thing-130000257.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-home-2026-rumors/",
        "description": "Apple has a long list of new products rumored for 2026, including a series of home products that will see the company establishing more of a presence in the smart home space. Robots are on the horizon for 2027, but the 2026 releases will be a little tamer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHomePod mini\n\r\nWe're expecting a new HomePod mini 2 to launch at any time. Apple isn't going to update the device's design, but we could get new colors. The ‌HomePod mini‌ 2 will have an updated S-series chip based on the Apple Watch Series 10 chip, and there's a possibility for sound improvements and improved real-time computational audio. Apple will also likely upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 for connectivity improvements, and it could get a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.\r\n\r\nThe current ‌HomePod mini‌ is $99, and that's not expected to change. \r\n\r\nHome Hub\n\r\nApple has been working on a home hub that will serve as a centralized location for all members of the family to control smart home devices, make calls, listen to music, get information like the weather, use Siri, view photos, see a family calendar, and more.\r\n\r\nRumors suggest the home hub will have presence sensors to detect when someone is in the room, and an included camera could be able to tell who is speaking to it so that it can pop up a personalized selection of apps and features for each user.\r\n\r\nFace ID, built-in speakers, and support for Apple Intelligence thanks to an A18 chip. While there won't be a dedicated App Store, the home hub will run Apple apps like Safari, Apple Music, Notes, Calendar, Photos, and Apple News.\r\n\r\nThere are two separate models, including one that's designed to be mounted on the wall and one that has a speaker base that looks like a ‌HomePod mini‌.\r\n\r\nSecurity Camera and Doorbell Camera\n\r\nApple is designing its own indoor security cameras that will connect to Apple Home and interface with the home hub. We've also heard rumors of a potential doorbell camera with ‌Face ID‌ that would be able to connect to a door lock. \r\n\r\nHomeKit Secure Video with end-to-end encryption, but little else is known at this time. There has been mixed information on when we might see Apple's security cameras, but they could come as early as 2026.\r\n\r\nLaunch Timing\n\r\nThe ‌HomePod mini‌ and home hub are expected early in the year, likely before WWDC. The cameras, if we get them in 2026, will likely come late in the year. Prior rumors suggested that Apple would release the home hub around the time that the new version of ‌Siri‌ launches. The smarter ‌Siri‌ was expected in iOS 26.4, but it may now be pushed back to iOS 26.5. \r\n\r\nRead More\n\r\nFor more on what to expect from Apple in 2026, we have a dedicated Apple Products guide that lists all of the devices on the horizon. We update it regularly, so it's a useful guide to bookmark and check every now and then to keep up to date with Apple's plans.\nThis article, \"Three New Apple Home Products Rumored for 2026\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/ai-agents-turned-super-bowl-viewers-into-one-high-iq-team-now-imagine-this",
        "description": "The average Fortune 1000 company has more than 30,000 employees and engineering, sales and marketing teams with hundreds of members. Equally large teams exist in government, science and defense organizations. And yet, research shows that the ideal size for a productive real-time conversation is only about 4 to 7 people.\nThe reason is simple: As groups grow larger, each person has less opportunity to speak and must wait longer to respond, increasing their frustration that their views are not sufficiently considered. This is true whether groups collaborate in person, by video or teleconference, or even by text chat (which buries users in a backlog of messages that reduce participation and undermine deliberation).  \nSimply put, productive team conversations do not scale.\nSo, what do you do if you have a large team and you want to leverage their knowledge, wisdom, insight and expertise? For many organizations, their only choice is to resort to polls, surveys or interviews. This will capture data about individual perspectives, but nobody will “feel heard” when the process is over, and it will rarely find optimal solutions.\nThis is because polls, surveys and interviews are not deliberative instruments. There is no give and take as team members debate issues, provide reasons and rationales, present arguments and counterarguments and ultimately converge on solutions by virtue of their deliberative merits. Surveys treat people as over-simplified data points, while interactive conversations treat people as thoughtful data processors. This difference is profound.\nI have been studying this issue for more than a decade, and I’m convinced that the best way to unlock the true collective intelligence of large teams is through authentic real-time conversations at scale. I am talking about thoughtful discussions where scores of people can brainstorm, prioritize and forecast together, ultimately converging on solutions that genuinely leverage their combined knowledge, wisdom and insight.\nBut conversations are impossible to scale, right?\nWrong — over the last few years, a new communication technology, Hyperchat AI, has emerged. It enables large, distributed teams to hold productive discussions where they can debate issues, brainstorm ideas, prioritize alternatives, provide arguments and counterarguments and efficiently come up with solutions.\nInspired by large natural systems, Hyperchat AI combines the biological principles of Swarm Intelligence with the emerging power of AI agents. It works by dividing any large, networked group into a set of small, interconnected subgroups, each sized for thoughtful real-time conversation by text, voice or video. The magical ingredient is a swarm of AI agents called “conversational surrogates” that participate in each local discussion and work to connect all the subgroups together into a single coherent deliberation.\nUsing Hyperchat AI, groups of potentially any size can debate issues, brainstorm ideas, prioritize options, forecast outcomes and solve problems in real-time.  And it works — research shows that when large teams hold conversations this way, they converge on smarter, faster and more accurate solutions. In one study I was personally involved in, groups connected by Hyperchat AI amplified their collective IQ to the 97th percentile.  \nIn another study, conducted in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, groups of 75 people holding conversations using Hyperchat AI technology said they felt more collaborative, productive and heard compared to traditional communication structures like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet or Slack. They also felt greater buy-in to the solutions that emerged.\nTo test the virtues of Hyperchat AI in a fun and timely format, I asked the research team at Unanimous AI (developer of Thinkscape, a platform that uses Hyperchat AI) to bring together 100 members of the public who watched the Super Bowl this Sunday and debate which Super Bowl ad was the most effective, and why?\nI know this is not a question of grand social importance, but the Super Bowl is among the most watched events in the world, both for the athletic spectacle and the ads. This year, a 30-second spot cost between $8 to 10 million, not including production costs. With that level of investment, every brand is looking to stand out, yet only a few can achieve that.  \nSo, we brought together 110 random members of the public — their only qualification being that they watched the Super Bowl — and asked them to discuss and debate the ads. Sixty-six unique ads ran during the game. Did any of them stand out strongly above the rest, and if so, why was it so effective?  \nThe 110 participants were divided into 24 subgroups, each with 4 or 5 humans and a single AI agent. Each agent was tasked with observing their subgroup, identifying key insights in real time, then share those insights with AI agents in other subgroups. When agents received those outside insights, they then participated in their local conversation, expressing the insight as a member of their group. This process weaves all the deliberations together into a single real-time conversation that flows seamlessly and converges in unison.\nAll told, the 110 human participants suggested 54 different ads for consideration, and they reached a decisive answer in only 10 minutes of hyper-connected discussion. And, because the AI agents were tracking the dynamics within all 24 local debates, the instant the conversation finished the system generated an ordered list of all 54 ads based on the conversational support across the full population. \nHere are the top ten as identified by the deliberating participants:\nAs you can see, the Pepsi ad that used Coke’s polar bear was found to be the most effective of the night by a wide margin.  In fact, the Thinkscape system reported that this was a statistically significant result for a population of randomly selected consumers (p<0.01).\nIn addition, the system automatically tracks the reasons that emerge in every subgroup, and the reactions to those reasons (whether it swayed opinions of others, inspired counterarguments, or both). This enables the system to instantly produce a deliberative overview for every ad produced, assessing why the group viewed each ad the way it did.\nHere is the reasoning instantly generated for the Polar Bear ad: \n“Our collective perspective is that the most effective Super Bowl ad of 2026 was the Pepsi Polar Bears spot. We found it effective due to its humor, clever use of polar bears, jab at Coca-Cola, memorability, nostalgic elements, wide appeal, product focus and ability to spark conversations. While some of us criticized it for focusing on a feud, a large majority felt it successfully captured the essence of a classic Super Bowl ad.”\nFor the record, the team at Unanimous AI also asked this real-time collective to consider a follow-up question, Which Super Bowl ad was the least effective and why?  This is what the system reported after 10 minutes of deliberation: \n“Our collective perspective is that the worst 2026 Super Bowl ad was the Coinbase spot. We found it lacking in clarity, with confusing messaging and a failure to explain the product effectively. Additionally, the ad was found by many to be annoying, cringey and low-effort, with little promotion of the product and a disconnect from Coinbase's services. Overall, it failed to build trust and was off-putting to many viewers.” Note: The selection of this ad was a statistically significant result (p<0.01) across the population. \nAgain, this was just a fun example for engaging the public, not a large deliberation of grand importance. That said, I have observed large groups, from analysts in large financial institutions to scientists at the Department of Energy, discussing important issues using this technology — and in all cases the groups seem to converge with increased speed, accuracy and buy-in. \nFor an overview of academic studies on Hyperchat AI, check out this recent paper.\nLouis Rosenberg earned his PhD from Stanford University, was a professor at California State University (Cal Poly) and has been awarded over 300 patents for his work in human-computer interaction, AI and collective intelligence.",

        "description": "The Crew-12 mission, SpaceX’s 20th human spaceflight, launched at 5:15 AM Eastern on February 13 from  Cape Canaveral in Florida. It’s expected to dock with the International Space Station today, February 14, at 3:15 PM, and you can watch the event below as it happens. By the time the mission’s Dragon capsule docks with the ISS, it will have traveled approximately 34 hours since lift off. Inside are NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency’s Sophie Adenot and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.\n\n\n\nThe four spacefarers are joining the three remaining passengers onboard the ISS after Crew-11 flew back to Earth a month earlier than planned. If you’ll recall, NASA made the decision to cut their mission short after one of the crew members had a medical issue that instruments on the ISS aren’t capable of diagnosing. While the crew member was stable, the agency decided to bring the whole mission home out of an abundance of caution. \nCrew-12 will be staying on the ISS for eight months and will conduct a number of scientific experiments, including ones related to human health and ones meant to advance technologies for future missions to the moon and Mars. They will study how  pneumonia-causing bacteria can lead to long-term heart damage, for instance, and will also look into how a person’s physical characteristics can affect blood flow during spaceflight. NASA’s live coverage for the docking starts at 1:15 PM. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/watch-the-nasa-spacex-crew-12-mission-dock-with-the-iss-180000450.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Threads users have complained about its recommendation algorithm since the dawn of time 2023. Users even started writing posts addressed to the algorithm, specifying the topics they wanted to see more of. Now, that’s part of the system: Users can write a post that begins with “dear algo” to adjust their preferences, officially.\nFor example, you could write: “Dear algo, show me more posts about sous vide recipes.” You can also ask to see fewer posts about topics you don’t want to see, like “Dear algo, stop showing me posts about air fryers.” You can even retweet other users’ “dear algo” posts to have those topics reflected in your feed. “Dear algo” posts will work for Threads users in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand, with more countries coming “soon.”\n— Mat Smith\nThe biggest stories in tech you might have missed.\n\nThe first Control Resonant gameplay trailer shows a sideways NYC \n\nApple’s Siri relaunch is reportedly behind schedule \n\nThe next Metal Gear Solid remaster collection arrives this summer\n\n\nElon Musk’s latest scheme is a satellite catapult on the Moon\nI think that’s a Drag Race song.\nWith a bigger focus on the Moon, Elon Musk is making some wild new plans. According to audio heard by The New York Times, Musk said xAI needed to build an AI satellite factory on the Moon with a gigantic catapult to launch the satellites into space. Sometimes you just want to be the Bond villain.\n“You have to go to the Moon” to build the required AI capabilities, Musk told employees. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.” Such a catapult would certainly need to be powerful — though the Moon has only one-sixth Earth’s gravity, the minimum escape velocity required for orbit is still around 3,800 mph, or five times the speed of sound. That’s currently possible with electromagnetic railguns, but the satellites would have to withstand that force.\nContinue reading.\nPokémon Pokopia is cosy AF\nStardew Valley + Animal Crossing X Pokémon.\nTMA\nNintendo\n\nIn a bid to distract from a lot of things, Nintendo’s new Pokémon game is a gently paced game where, instead of playing as a generic trainer, you take control of a sole Ditto. \nAs a Ditto, you can transform into other Pokémon, though the process is sort of incomplete, meaning you can only learn one skill from the monsters you befriend. Instead of using tools, you can transform into other Pokémon (like Lapras or Dragonite) to use their abilities to traverse obstacles or shape the world around you.\nContinue reading.\nSony WF-1000XM6 headphones review\nFacing tougher competition.\nTMA\nEngadget\n\nSony unveiled the latest entry in its best wireless earbud series, the WF-1000XM6, featuring yet another redesign, both inside and out. Once again, strong features and audio performance remain, but competition from all sides is tougher than ever. As Billy Steele explains in his review, if you want the strongest active noise cancellation, that will be Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If the best sound quality is your goal, the Technics AZ100 is your best bet in this price range. I’ll also mention Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, which offers great sound quality, respectable ANC and a comfier fit than the M6. The WF-1000XM6 is available now for $330.\nContinue reading.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-meta-turned-threads-algorithm-complaints-into-an-official-feature-121500663.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by Reuters, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptis Wireless initially won $506 million from Apple in a 2020 jury trial, but the damages were thrown out after Apple appealed because the jury didn't calculate damages with an understanding of fair and reasonable essential patent (FRAND) terms. A second jury trial was held in 2021 to recalculate damages, and the jury awarded Optis $300 million. Apple again appealed, and the appeals court vacated the $300 million verdict because the district court provided the jury with incorrect instructions.\r\n\r\nReuters, Apple said it was pleased the jury rejected Optis's infringement claims.\r\n\"We thank the jury for their time, and we're pleased they rejected Optis' false claims. Optis makes no products, and its sole business is to sue companies, which it has done repeatedly to Apple in an attempt to obtain an excessive payout.\"\n\r\nOptis is likely to appeal the ruling, sending it back to the appeals court again. Apple is also fighting Optis in the UK, where a UK court ordered Apple to pay $502 million. Apple appealed the decision and the UK Supreme Court will hear the case in June 2026.\nTags: Patent Lawsuits, Patent Trials\nThis article, \"Apple Wins Third Jury Trial Against Optis, Avoiding Hundreds of Millions in Patent Damages\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",
