      "description": "Nvidia shares soared Friday as investors snapped up shares of companies positioned to benefit from the vast sum of money that big technology firms have said they’ll spend on artificial intelligence infrastructure this year. Amazon sparked the rebound after the technology giant said during an earnings call that it plans to spend $200 billion on data centers, chips and other equipment this year. All told, Amazon, along with Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, are expected to shell out roughly $650 billion for AI tools in 2026, about 60% more than the prior year. Mark Mahaney, Senior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research at Evercore ISI, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. He speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.
