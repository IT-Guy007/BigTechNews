      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
      "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-gpt-5-3-codex-drops-as-anthropic-upgrades-claude-ai-coding-wars-heat",
      "description": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.\nThe dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\n\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"\nThat claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI's announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\nOpenAI's new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic's Claude by double digits\nThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.\nThe Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex's 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model's 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic's Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.\nOpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\n\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.\nFrom coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecycle\nPerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI's positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"\nThis expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.\nThe expansion signals OpenAI's ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.\nOpenAI's first 'high capability' cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fund\nThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\n\"While we don't have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.\nAltman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"\nThe company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.\nSuper Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic's advertising campaign 'clearly dishonest' as rivalry turns personal\nThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday's release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI's intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.\nBoth companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”\nThe head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI's recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. \n\nAltman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"\nHe went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"\nEnterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI's market share faces pressure from Anthropic and Google\nThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.\nAccording to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024's actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.\nThe a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic's share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.\nEnterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company's most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.\nFor software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies' coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.\nBoth AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platforms\nThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\n\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, told reporters this week.\nThis follows Monday's launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.\nTrillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding race\nThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.\nAnthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.\nGPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI's announcement—a reference to Nvidia's latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.\nThe financial pressure adds urgency to both companies' enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.\nOpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop app\nLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.\nThe model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\n\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it's doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"\nThe company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"\nHe concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"\nWhether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What's clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-opus-4-6-brings-1m-token-context-and-agent-teams-to-take",
        "description": "Anthropic on Thursday released Claude Opus 4.6, a major upgrade to its flagship artificial intelligence model that the company says plans more carefully, sustains longer autonomous workflows, and outperforms competitors including OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on key enterprise benchmarks — a release that arrives at a tumultuous moment for the AI industry and global software markets.\nThe launch comes just three days after OpenAI released its own Codex desktop application in a direct challenge to Anthropic's Claude Code momentum, and amid a $285 billion rout in software and services stocks that investors attribute partly to fears that Anthropic's AI tools could disrupt established enterprise software businesses.\nFor the first time, Anthropic's Opus-class models will feature a 1 million token context window, allowing the AI to process and reason across vastly more information than previous versions. The company also introduced \"agent teams\" in Claude Code — a research preview feature that enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a coding project, coordinating autonomously.\n\"We're focused on building the most capable, reliable, and safe AI systems,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat about the announcements. \"Opus 4.6 is even better at planning, helping solve the most complex coding tasks. And the new agent teams feature means users can split work across multiple agents — one on the frontend, one on the API, one on the migration — each owning its piece and coordinating directly with the others.\"\n\nWhy OpenAI and Anthropic are locked in an all-out war for enterprise developers\nThe release intensifies an already fierce competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, the two most valuable privately held AI companies in the world. OpenAI on Monday released a new desktop application for its Codex artificial intelligence coding system, a tool the company says transforms software development from a collaborative exercise with a single AI assistant into something more akin to managing a team of autonomous workers.\nAI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor.\nThe timing of Anthropic's release — just 72 hours after OpenAI's Codex launch — underscores the breakneck pace of competition in AI development tools. OpenAI faces intensifying competition from Anthropic, which posted the largest share increase of any frontier lab since May 2025, according to a recent Andreessen Horowitz survey. Forty-four percent of enterprises now use Anthropic in production, driven by rapid capability gains in software development since late 2024. The desktop launch is a strategic counter to Claude Code's momentum.\nAccording to Anthropic's announcement, Opus 4.6 achieves the highest score on Terminal-Bench 2.0, an agentic coding evaluation, and leads all other frontier models on Humanity's Last Exam, a complex multi-discipline reasoning test. On GDPval-AA — a benchmark measuring performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal and other domains — Opus 4.6 outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 ELO points, which translates to obtaining a higher score approximately 70% of the time.\nInside Claude Code's $1 billion revenue milestone and growing enterprise footprint\nThe stakes are substantial. Asked about Claude Code's financial performance, the Anthropic spokesperson noted that in November, the company announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in run rate revenue only six months after becoming generally available in May 2025.\nThe spokesperson highlighted major enterprise deployments: \"Claude Code is used by Uber across teams like software engineering, data science, finance, and trust and safety; wall-to-wall deployment across Salesforce's global engineering org; tens of thousands of devs at Accenture; and companies across industries like Spotify, Rakuten, Snowflake, Novo Nordisk, and Ramp.\"\nThat enterprise traction has translated into skyrocketing valuations. Earlier this month, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a $10 billion funding round at a $350 billion valuation. Bloomberg reported that Anthropic is simultaneously working on a tender offer that would allow employees to sell shares at that valuation, offering liquidity to staffers who have watched the company's worth multiply since its 2021 founding.\nHow Opus 4.6 solves the 'context rot' problem that has plagued AI models\nOne of Opus 4.6's most significant technical improvements addresses what the AI industry calls \"context rot\"—the degradation of model performance as conversations grow longer. Anthropic says Opus 4.6 scores 76% on MRCR v2, a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark testing a model's ability to retrieve information hidden in vast amounts of text, compared to just 18.5% for Sonnet 4.5.\n\"This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance,\" the company said in its announcement.\nThe model also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens — enough to complete substantial coding tasks or documents without breaking them into multiple requests.\nFor developers, Anthropic is introducing several new API features alongside the model: adaptive thinking, which allows Claude to decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful rather than requiring a binary on-off choice; four effort levels (low, medium, high, max) to control intelligence, speed and cost tradeoffs; and context compaction, a beta feature that automatically summarizes older context to enable longer-running tasks.\nAnthropic's delicate balancing act: Building powerful AI agents without losing control\nAnthropic, which has built its brand around AI safety research, emphasized that Opus 4.6 maintains alignment with its predecessors despite its enhanced capabilities. On the company's automated behavior audit measuring misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, and cooperation with misuse, Opus 4.6 \"showed a low rate\" of problematic responses while also achieving \"the lowest rate of over-refusals — where the model fails to answer benign queries — of any recent Claude model.\"\nWhen asked how Anthropic thinks about safety guardrails as Claude becomes more agentic, particularly with multiple agents coordinating autonomously, the spokesperson pointed to the company's published framework: \"Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work but it's important that agents continue to be safe, reliable, and trustworthy. We outlined our framework for developing safe and trustworthy agents last year which shares core principles developers should consider when building agents.\"\nThe company said it has developed six new cybersecurity probes to detect potentially harmful uses of the model's enhanced capabilities, and is using Opus 4.6 to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software as part of defensive cybersecurity efforts.\nSam Altman vs. Dario Amodei: The Super Bowl ad battle that exposed AI's deepest divisions\nThe rivalry between Anthropic and OpenAI has spilled into consumer marketing in dramatic fashion. Both companies will feature prominently during Sunday's Super Bowl. Anthropic is airing commercials that mock OpenAI's decision to begin testing advertisements in ChatGPT, with the tagline: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded by calling the ads \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest,\" posting on X that his company would \"obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them\" and that \"Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI\" while serving \"an expensive product to rich people.\"\nThe exchange highlights a fundamental strategic divergence: OpenAI has moved to monetize its massive free user base through advertising, while Anthropic has focused almost exclusively on enterprise sales and premium subscriptions.\n\nThe $285 billion stock selloff that revealed Wall Street's AI anxiety\nThe launch occurs against a backdrop of historic market volatility in software stocks. A new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across the software, financial services and asset management sectors on Tuesday as investors raced to dump shares with even the slightest exposure. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks sank 6%, its biggest one-day decline since April's tariff-fueled selloff.\nThe selloff was triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology. One trigger for Tuesday's selloff was Anthropic's launch of plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent on Friday, enabling automated tasks across legal, sales, marketing and data analysis.\nThomson Reuters plunged 15.83% Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop on record; and Legalzoom.com sank 19.68%. European legal software providers including RELX, owner of LexisNexis, and Wolters Kluwer experienced their worst single-day performances in decades.\nNot everyone agrees the selloff is warranted. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Tuesday that fears AI would replace software and related tools were \"illogical\" and \"time will prove itself.\" Mark Murphy, head of U.S. enterprise software research at JPMorgan, said in a Reuters report it \"feels like an illogical leap\" to say a new plug-in from an LLM would \"replace every layer of mission-critical enterprise software.\"\nWhat Claude's new PowerPoint integration means for Microsoft's AI strategy\nAmong the more notable product announcements: Anthropic is releasing Claude in PowerPoint in research preview, allowing users to create presentations using the same AI capabilities that power Claude's document and spreadsheet work. The integration puts Claude directly inside a core Microsoft product — an unusual arrangement given Microsoft's 27% stake in OpenAI.\nThe Anthropic spokesperson framed the move pragmatically in an interview with VentureBeat: \"Microsoft has an official add-in marketplace for Office products with multiple add-ins available to help people with slide creation and iteration. Any developer can build a plugin for Excel or PowerPoint. We're participating in that ecosystem to bring Claude into PowerPoint. This is about participating in the ecosystem and giving users the ability to work with the tools that they want, in the programs they want.\"\nThe data behind enterprise AI adoption: Who's winning and who's losing ground\nData from a16z's recent enterprise AI survey suggests both Anthropic and OpenAI face an increasingly competitive landscape. While OpenAI remains the most widely used AI provider in the enterprise, with approximately 77% of surveyed companies using it in production in January 2026, Anthropic's adoption is rising rapidly — from near-zero in March 2024 to approximately 40% using it in production by January 2026.\nThe survey data also shows that 75% of Anthropic's enterprise customers are using it in production, with 89% either testing or in production — figures that slightly exceed OpenAI's 46% in production and 73% testing or in production rates among its customer base.\nEnterprise spending on AI continues to accelerate. Average enterprise LLM spend reached $7 million in 2025, up 180% from $2.5 million in 2024, with projections suggesting $11.6 million in 2026 — a 65% increase year-over-year.\nPricing, availability, and what developers need to know about Claude Opus 4.6\nOpus 4.6 is available immediately on claude.ai, the Claude API, and major cloud platforms. Developers can access it via claude-opus-4-6 through the API. Pricing remains unchanged at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with premium pricing of $10/$37.50 for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens using the 1 million token context window.\nFor users who find Opus 4.6 \"overthinking\" simpler tasks — a characteristic Anthropic acknowledges can add cost and latency — the company recommends adjusting the effort parameter from its default high setting to medium.\nThe recommendation captures something essential about where the AI industry now stands. These models have grown so capable that their creators must now teach customers how to make them think less. Whether that represents a breakthrough or a warning sign depends entirely on which side of the disruption you're standing on — and whether you remembered to sell your software stocks before Tuesday.",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/openais-gpt-5-3-codex-drops-as-anthropic-upgrades-claude-ai-coding-wars-heat",
        "description": "OpenAI on Wednesday released GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade, Claude Opus 4.6. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market.\nThe dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics.\n\"I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X minutes after the launch. He later added: \"It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.\"\nThat claim — that the model helped build itself — is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI's announcement, the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as \"our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\nOpenAI's new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic's Claude by double digits\nThe new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex achieves 57% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering that spans four programming languages and tests contamination-resistant, industrially relevant challenges. It scores 77.3% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills essential for coding agents, and 64% on OSWorld, an agentic computer-use benchmark where models must complete productivity tasks in visual desktop environments.\nThe Terminal-Bench 2.0 result is particularly striking. According to performance data released Wednesday, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3% compared to GPT-5.2-Codex's 64.0% and the base GPT-5.2 model's 62.2% — a 13-percentage-point leap in a single generation. One user on X noted that the score \"absolutely demolished\" Anthropic's Opus 4.6, which reportedly achieved 65.4% on the same benchmark.\nOpenAI also claims the model accomplishes these results with dramatically improved efficiency: less than half the tokens of its predecessor for equivalent tasks, plus more than 25% faster inference per token.\n\"Notably, GPT-5.3-Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users simply build more,\" the company stated in its announcement.\nFrom coding assistant to computer operator: GPT-5.3-Codex aims to automate the entire software development lifecycle\nPerhaps more significant than the benchmark improvements is OpenAI's positioning of GPT-5.3-Codex as a model that transcends pure coding. The company explicitly states that \"Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.\"\nThis expanded capability set includes debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing product requirement documents, editing copy, conducting user research, building slide decks, and analyzing data in spreadsheet applications. The model shows strong performance on GDPVal, an OpenAI evaluation released in 2025 that measures performance on well-specified knowledge-work tasks across 44 occupations.\nThe expansion signals OpenAI's ambition to capture not just the developer tools market but the broader enterprise productivity software space — a market that includes established players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow, all of whom are racing to embed AI agents into their platforms.\nOpenAI's first 'high capability' cybersecurity model prompts new safety protocols and a $10 million defense fund\nThe pivot toward general-purpose computing brings new security considerations. In a notable disclosure, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5.3-Codex is the first model it classifies as \"High capability\" for cybersecurity-related tasks under its Preparedness Framework, and the first directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities.\n\"While we don't have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we're taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date,\" the company stated. Mitigations include dual-use safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines incorporating threat intelligence.\nAltman highlighted this development on X: \"This is our first model that hits 'high' for cybersecurity on our preparedness framework. We are piloting a Trusted Access framework, and committing $10 million in API credits to accelerate cyber defense.\"\nThe company is also expanding the private beta of Aardvark, its security research agent, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects. OpenAI cited Next.js as an example where a security researcher used Codex to discover vulnerabilities disclosed last week.\nSuper Bowl showdown: Sam Altman calls Anthropic's advertising campaign 'clearly dishonest' as rivalry turns personal\nThe cybersecurity announcement, however, has been overshadowed by the increasingly personal nature of the OpenAI-Anthropic rivalry. The timing of Wednesday's release cannot be understood without the context of OpenAI's intensifying competition with Anthropic, the AI safety-focused startup founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including Dario and Daniela Amodei.\nBoth companies scheduled major product announcements for 10 a.m. Pacific Time today. Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, which it describes as its \"smartest model\" that \"plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.”\nThe head-to-head timing follows a week of escalating tensions. Anthropic announced it will air Super Bowl advertisements mocking OpenAI's recent decision to begin testing ads within ChatGPT for free users. \n\nAltman responded with unusual directness, calling the advertisements \"funny\" but \"clearly dishonest\" in an extensive X post.\n\"We would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,\" Altman wrote. \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"\nHe went further, characterizing Anthropic as an \"authoritarian company\" that \"wants to control what people do with AI.\"\n\"Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,\" Altman wrote. \"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do.\"\nEnterprise AI spending surges past projections as OpenAI's market share faces pressure from Anthropic and Google\nThe public sparring masks a deadly serious business competition. The rivalry plays out against a backdrop of explosive enterprise AI adoption, where both companies are fighting for position in a rapidly expanding market.\nAccording to survey data from Andreessen Horowitz released this week, enterprise spending on large language models has dramatically outpaced even bullish projections. Average enterprise LLM spending reached $7 million in 2025, 180% higher than 2024's actual spending of $2.5 million — and 56% above what enterprises had projected for 2025 just a year earlier. Spending is projected to reach $11.6 million per enterprise in 2026, a further 65% increase.\nThe a16z data reveals shifting market dynamics that help explain the intensity of the competition. OpenAI maintains the largest average share of enterprise AI wallet, but that share is shrinking — from 62% in 2024 to a projected 53% in 2026. Anthropic's share, meanwhile, has grown from 14% to a projected 18% over the same period, with Google showing similar gains.\nEnterprise adoption patterns tell a more nuanced story. While OpenAI leads in overall usage, only 46% of surveyed OpenAI customers are using its most capable models in production, compared to 75% for Anthropic and 76% for Google. When including testing environments, 89% of Anthropic customers are testing or using the company's most capable models — the highest rate among major providers.\nFor software development specifically — one of the primary use cases for both companies' coding agents — the a16z survey shows OpenAI with approximately 35% market share, with Anthropic claiming a substantial and growing portion of the remainder.\nBoth AI labs race to become the enterprise operating system of choice, moving beyond models to full-stack platforms\nThese market dynamics explain why both companies are positioning themselves as platforms rather than mere model providers. OpenAI on Wednesday also launched Frontier, a new platform designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for businesses adopting a range of AI tools — including those developed by third parties — that can operate together seamlessly.\n\"We can be the partner of choice for AI transformation for enterprise. The sky is the limit in terms of revenue we can generate from a platform like that,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, told reporters this week.\nThis follows Monday's launch of the Codex desktop application for macOS, which OpenAI says has already surpassed 500,000 downloads. The app enables users to manage multiple AI coding agents simultaneously — a capability that becomes increasingly important as enterprises deploy agents for complex, long-running tasks.\nTrillion-dollar compute obligations and $350 billion valuations reveal the massive financial stakes driving the AI coding race\nThe platform ambitions require extraordinary capital. The dueling launches underscore the staggering financial requirements of frontier AI development, with both companies burning through billions while racing to establish market dominance.\nAnthropic is currently in discussions for a funding round that could bring in more than $20 billion at a valuation of at least $350 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is simultaneously planning an employee tender offer at that valuation.\nOpenAI, meanwhile, has disclosed that it owes more than $1 trillion in financial obligations to backers — including Oracle, Microsoft, and Nvidia — that are essentially fronting compute costs in expectation of future returns.\nGPT-5.3-Codex was \"co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems,\" according to OpenAI's announcement—a reference to Nvidia's latest Blackwell-generation AI supercomputing architecture.\nThe financial pressure adds urgency to both companies' enterprise strategies. Unlike established tech giants with diversified revenue streams, both Anthropic and OpenAI must prove they can generate sufficient revenue from AI products to justify their extraordinary valuations and infrastructure costs.\nOpenAI promises more Codex features in coming weeks as 500,000 users download the new desktop app\nLooking ahead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex is available immediately for paid ChatGPT users across all Codex surfaces: the desktop app, command-line interface, IDE extensions, and web interface. API access is expected to follow.\nThe model includes a new interactivity feature: users can choose between \"pragmatic\" or \"friendly\" personalities — a customization Altman suggests users feel strongly about. More substantively, the model provides frequent progress updates during tasks, allowing users to interact in real time, ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward solutions without losing context.\n\"Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time,\" OpenAI stated. \"GPT-5.3-Codex talks through what it's doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.\"\nThe company promises more capabilities in the coming weeks, with Altman declaring: \"I believe Codex is going to win.\"\nHe concluded his response to Anthropic with a philosophical statement that frames the competition in stark terms: \"This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.\"\nWhether that message resonates with enterprise customers — who according to a16z data cite trust, security, and compliance as their top concerns — remains to be seen. What's clear is that the AI coding wars have begun in earnest, and neither company intends to cede ground.",

        "description": "Super Bowl LX is nearly here, with the Seattle Seahawks taking on the New England Patriots. While Bad Bunny will be the star of the halftime show, AI could be the star of the commercial breaks, much like crypto was a few years ago.\nLast year’s Super Bowl featured a Google Gemini ad that fumbled a Gouda cheese stat, and this year’s game is already slated to include an ad for Anthropic’s AI platform that takes jabs at its competitors, namely OpenAI. AI-generated ads could make an appearance, too. \nSuper Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30PM ET/3:30PM PT on Sunday, February 8th at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. \nSam Altman responds to Anthropic’s ‘funny’ Super Bowl ads\n\t\t\t\nAnthropic’s first Super Bowl ad dunks on ChatGPT.\n\t\t\t\nDon’t expect any Kalshi or Polymarket ads during the Super Bowl.",

        "description": "Meta is developing a standalone app for Vibes, its feed of AI-generated videos, according to reports from TechCrunch and Platformer. Vibes was introduced as a feature in the Meta AI app in September 2025. Similar to OpenAI's Sora app, Vibes lets users prompt Meta AI to create TikTok-style vertical videos.\n\"Following the strong early traction of Vibes within Meta AI, we are testing a standalone app to build on that momentum,\" Meta said in a statement. \"We’ve seen that users are increasingly leaning into the format to create, discover, and share AI-generated video with friends. This standalone app provides a dedicated home for that experience, offering people a more focused and immersive environment. We will look to expand the app further based on what we learn from the community.\"\nMeta has yet to share specific numbers for how many people actually use Vibes, but the company does claim that Meta AI usage has continued to grow since Vibes launched. Breaking the feature out into its own app could allow Meta to add more functionality without cluttering the existing Meta AI app. The company believes AI-generated content will be the next big source of engagement on platforms, and said in an October 2025 earnings call that it planned to push more AI images and videos into its recommendation algorithm. A dedicated app for creating videos like Vibes could be one way Meta hopes to do that.\nAs Meta's main competitor in the burgeoning field of AI-first social media, OpenAI has continued to iterate on its Sora app, adding ways for characters and pets to cameo in videos, and signing a deal with Disney to allow users to generate content with Disney characters. Considering the company has licensed celebrity likenesses in the past, it doesn't seem impossible that Meta could pursue similar deals. Whatever happens, AI-generated videos appear like they'll be increasingly inescapable.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-is-giving-its-ai-slop-feed-an-app-of-its-own-192208200.html?src=rss",

        "description": "With gaming becoming an ever-smaller part of NVIDIA's lucrative business, the company reportedly won't bother releasing new graphics cards this year. The Information reported on Thursday that NVIDIA has pushed back its plan to release an update to the RTX 50 line in 2026. This would be the first time in three decades that the company hasn't launched new gaming chips. The culprit? Why, AI, of course.\nAI demand has driven the current memory chip shortage, throwing the consumer electronics industry out of kilter. Many product prices are expected to rise (as if tariffs hadn't already done enough damage there). And the scarcity of memory chips has made components that rely on them, including GPUs, nearly impossible to find. Even the auto industry isn't spared.\nFacing those constraints, NVIDIA, which made its bones on graphics chips for PCs and gaming consoles, is essentially brushing off that demographic. The Information notes that in the first nine months of 2022, NVIDIA's gaming GPUs made up 35 percent of its total revenue. During that same period in 2025, only around 8 percent came from gaming components. In addition, NVIDIA's AI chips have much higher profit margins: 65 percent vs. 40 percent for graphics cards.\nThat means gamers, already hard-pressed to find last year's RTX 50 series, likely won't get the expected \"Super\" version in 2026. On top of that, The Information says the delay will also push back NVIDIA's next-gen graphics card (likely \"RTX 60\"). That component was initially expected to begin mass production at the end of 2027.\nBut hey, at least you can shop (and view ads!) in ChatGPT, have a talk with your Gmail inbox and record everything the people around you say. Who needs games anyway, right?\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-reportedly-wont-release-new-graphics-cards-this-year-173002651.html?src=rss",

The affected account holders had their email addresses and phone numbers scraped in a hack that occurred in October 2025.\nIn an email posted on Bluesky, Substack CEO, Christ Best, said the company became aware of the breach on February 3, which involved an \"unauthorized third party to access limited user data without permission.\" While internal metadata was also shared in the hack, Best said that credit card numbers and other financial details were not. No passwords were obtained either.\n\nAs well as apologizing to Substack users, the company’s CEO also said in the email that the security vulnerabilities have now been addressed. \"We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,\" he said. Best added that there is no evidence that any of the stolen data is being \"misused,\" but advised the affected account holders to be wary of suspicious emails or text messages they may receive. \nThe newsletter platform has not disclosed how many accounts were hacked, but Bleeping Computer reported that a database allegedly containing 697, 313 stolen data records from Substack was leaked on the hacking forum BreachForums.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/substack-ceo-informs-users-of-a-data-breach-151113809.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/fundamental-emerges-from-stealth-with-first-major-foundation-model-trained",
        "description": "The deep learning revolution has a curious blind spot: the spreadsheet. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have mastered the nuances of human prose and image generators have conquered the digital canvas, the structured, relational data that underpins the global economy — the rows and columns of ERP systems, CRMs, and financial ledgers — has so far been treated as just another file format similar to text or PDFs.\nThat's left enterprises to forecast business outcomes using the typical bespoke, labor-intensive data science process of manual feature engineering and classic machine learning algorithms that predate modern deep learning.\nBut now Fundamental, a San Francisco-based AI firm co-founded by DeepMind alumni, is launching today with $255 million in total funding to bridge this gap. \nEmerging from stealth, the company is debuting NEXUS, a Large Tabular Model (LTM) designed to treat business data not as a simple sequence of words, but as a complex web of non-linear relationships.\nThe tech: moving beyond sequential logic\nMost current AI models are built on sequential logic — predicting the next word in a sentence or the next pixel in a frame. \nHowever, enterprise data is inherently non-sequential. A customer’s churn risk isn't just a timeline; it's a multi-dimensional intersection of transaction frequency, support ticket sentiment, and regional economic shifts. Existing LLMs struggle with this because they are poorly suited to the size and dimensionality constraints of enterprise-scale tables.\n\"The most valuable data in the world lives in tables and until now there has been no good foundation model built specifically to understand it,\" said Jeremy Fraenkel, CEO and Co-founder of Fundamental. \nIn a recent interview with VentureBeat, Fraenkel emphasized that while the AI world is obsessed with text, audio, and video, tables remain the largest modality for enterprises. \"LLMs really cannot handle this type of data very well,\" he explained, \"and enterprises currently rely on very old-school machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions.\"\nNEXUS was trained on billions of real-world tabular datasets using Amazon SageMaker HyperPod. Unlike traditional XGBoost or Random Forest models, which require data scientists to manually define features — the specific variables the model should look at — NEXUS is designed to ingest raw tables directly. \nIt identifies latent patterns across columns and rows that human analysts might miss, effectively reading the hidden language of the grid to understand non-linear interactions.\nThe tokenization trap\nA primary reason traditional LLMs fail at tabular data is how they process numbers. Fraenkel explains that LLMs tokenize numbers the same way they tokenize words, breaking them into smaller chunks. \"The problem is they apply the same thing to numbers. Tables are, by and large, all numerical,\" Fraenkel noted. \"If you have a number like 2.3, the '2', the '.', and the '3' are seen as three different tokens. That essentially means you lose the understanding of the distribution of numbers. It's not like a calculator; you don't always get the right answer because the model doesn't understand the concept of numbers natively.\"\nFurthermore, tabular data is order-invariant in a way that language is not. Fraenkel uses a healthcare example to illustrate: \"If I give you a table with hundreds of thousands of patients and ask you to predict which of them has diabetes, it shouldn't matter if the first column is height and the second is weight, or vice versa.\" \nWhile LLMs are highly sensitive to the order of words in a prompt, NEXUS is architected to understand that shifting column positions should not impact the underlying prediction.\nOperating at the predictive layer\nRecent high-profile integrations, such as Anthropic’s Claude appearing directly within Microsoft Excel, have suggested that LLMs are already solving tables. \nHowever, Fraenkel distinguishes Fundamental’s work as operating at a fundamentally different layer: the predictive layer. \"What they are doing is essentially at the formula layer—formulas are text, they are like code,\" he said. \"We aren't trying to allow you to build a financial model in Excel. We are helping you make a forecast.\"\nNEXUS is designed for split-second decisions where a human isn't in the loop, such as a credit card provider determining if a transaction is fraudulent the moment you swipe. \nWhile tools like Claude can summarize a spreadsheet, NEXUS is built to predict the next row—whether that is an equipment failure in a factory or the probability of a patient being readmitted to a hospital.\nArchitecture and availability\nThe core value proposition of Fundamental is the radical reduction of time-to-insight. Traditionally, building a predictive model could take months of manual labor. \n\"You have to hire an army of data scientists to build all of those data pipelines to process and clean the data,\" Fraenkel explained. \"If there are missing values or inconsistent data, your model won't work. You have to build those pipelines for every single use case.\" \nFundamental claims NEXUS replaces this entire manual process with just one line of code. Because the model has been pre-trained on a billion tables, it doesn't require the same level of task-specific training or feature engineering that traditional algorithms do.\nAs Fundamental moves from its stealth phase into the broader market, it does so with a commercial structure designed to bypass the traditional friction of enterprise software adoption. \nThe company has already secured several seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 organizations, a feat facilitated by a strategic go-to-market architecture where Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as the seller of record on the AWS Marketplace. \nThis allows enterprise leaders to procure and deploy NEXUS using existing AWS credits, effectively treating predictive intelligence as a standard utility alongside compute and storage. For the engineers tasked with implementation, the experience is high-impact but low-friction; NEXUS operates via a Python-based interface at a purely predictive layer rather than a conversational one. \nDevelopers connect raw tables directly to the model and label specific target columns—such as a credit default probability or a maintenance risk score—to trigger the forecast. The model then returns regressions or classifications directly into the enterprise data stack, functioning as a silent, high-speed engine for automated decision-making rather than a chat-based assistant.\nThe societal stakes: beyond the bottom line\nWhile the commercial implications of demand forecasting and price prediction are clear, Fundamental is emphasizing the societal benefit of predictive intelligence. \nThe company highlights key areas where NEXUS can prevent catastrophic outcomes by identifying signals hidden in structured data. \nBy analyzing sensor data and maintenance records, NEXUS can predict failures like pipe corrosion. The company points to the Flint water crisis — which cost over $1 billion in repairs — as an example where predictive monitoring could have prevented life-threatening contamination.\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 crisis, PPE shortages cost hospitals $323 billion in a single year. Fundamental argues that by using manufacturing and epidemiological data, NEXUS can predict shortages 4-6 weeks before peak demand, triggering emergency manufacturing in time to save lives.\nOn the climate front, NEXUS aims to provide 30-60 day flood and drought predictions, such as for the 2022 Pakistan floods which caused $30 billion in damages. \nFinally, the model is being used to predict hospital readmission risks by analyzing patient demographics and social determinants. As the company puts it: \"A single mother working two jobs shouldn't end up back in the ER because we failed to predict she'd need follow-up care.\"\nPerformance vs. latency\nIn the enterprise world, the definition of better varies by industry. For some, it is speed; for others, it is raw accuracy. \n\"In terms of latency, it depends on the use case,\" Fraenkel explains. \"If you are a researcher trying to understand what drugs to administer to a patient in Africa, latency doesn't matter as much. You are trying to make a more accurate decision that can end up saving the most lives possible.\"\nIn contrast, for a bank or hedge fund, even a marginal increase in accuracy translates to massive value.\n\"Increasing the prediction accuracy by half a percent is worth billions of dollars for a bank,\" Fraenkel says. \"For different use cases, the magnitude of the percentage increase changes, but we can get you to a better performance than what you have currently.\"\nAmbitious vision receives big backing\nThe $225 million Series A, led by Oak HC/FT with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, and Battery Ventures, signals high-conviction belief that tabular data is the next great frontier. \nNotable angel investors including leaders from Perplexity, Wiz, Brex, and Datadog further validate the company's pedigree. \nAnnie Lamont, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Oak HC/FT, articulated the sentiment: \"The significance of Fundamental's model is hard to overstate—structured, relational data has yet to see the benefits of the deep learning revolution.\"\nFundamental is positioning itself not just as another AI tool, but as a new category of enterprise AI. With a team of approximately 35 based in San Francisco, the company is moving away from the bespoke model era and toward a foundation model era for tables. \n\"Those traditional algorithms have been the same for the last 10 years; they are not improving,\" Fraenkel said. \"Our models keep improving. We are doing the same thing for tables that ChatGPT did for text.\"\nPartnering with AWS\nThrough a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), NEXUS is integrated directly into the AWS dashboard. AWS customers can deploy the model using their existing credits and infrastructure. Fraenkel describes this as a \"very unique agreement,\" noting Fundamental is one of only two AI companies to have established such a deep, multi-layered partnership with Amazon.\nOne of the most significant hurdles for enterprise AI is data privacy. Companies are often unwilling to move sensitive data to a third-party infrastructure. \nTo solve this, Fundamental and Amazon achieved a massive engineering feat: the ability to deploy fully encrypted models—both the architecture and the weights—directly within the customer's own environment. \"Customers can be confident the data sits with them,\" Fraenkel said. \"We are the first, and currently only, company to have built such a solution.\"\nFundamental’s emergence is an attempt to redefine the OS for business decisions. If NEXUS performs as advertised—handling financial fraud, energy prices, and supply chain disruptions with a single, generalized model—it will mark the moment where AI finally learned to read the spreadsheets that actually run the world. The Power to Predict is no longer about looking at what happened yesterday; it is about uncovering the hidden language of tables to determine what happens tomorrow.",

        "description": "Apple expanded its lead in the global tablet market in late 2025 as overall shipments rebounded, according to new research from Omdia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlobal tablet shipments reportedly reached 162 million units in 2025, representing 9.8% year-over-year growth. The research firm said the strongest momentum occurred during the holiday quarter, when shipments reached 44 million units, also up 9.8% compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Omdia described the annual total as the highest shipment volume recorded since the surge in demand seen in 2020, partly caused by anticipation of memory supply constraints.\r\n\r\niPad and the M5 iPad Pro.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter results increased Apple's market share to 44.9%. This placed Apple well ahead of other tablet vendors during the holiday quarter, with Samsung at 14.7%, Lenovo at 8.8%, Huawei at 6.9%, and Xiaomi at 6.4%. Other manufacturers collectively accounted for the remaining 18.3% of shipments.\r\n\r\nThe report also highlighted changes in how tablets are expected to be positioned in the coming years, including greater emphasis on ecosystem integration and artificial intelligence features:\r\n\r\nOn the product side, we expect a shift in how tablets are positioned and marketed, with vendors framing them as ecosystem-centric devices in a more controlled demand environment. This includes the introduction of cross-OS functionality and a focus on AI-driven experiences. Recent examples include Lenovo's Qira, which operates across Windows and Android to deliver a more seamless user experience and reduce friction between AI assistants. In addition, the collaboration between Apple and Google to use Gemini for future Apple Intelligence features represents a positive step forward for the generative AI ecosystem across its device portfolio, including iPads.\n\r\n\r\nTag: Omdia\nThis article, \"iPad Demand Surges as Apple Strengthens Grip on Tablet Market\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable iPhone as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to a new supply chain report from The Elec, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display. The report says the company is currently testing two options for this outer film: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and clear polyimide (CPI).\r\n\r\nMost of today's foldable displays use ultra-thin glass to improve clarity and rigidity, but the glass still requires a flexible polymer film on top to prevent scratches and damage. This is the layer that users actually touch, making it a key factor in overall durability and feel.\r\n\r\nThe Elec says Apple's evaluation of CPI is rooted in a wish to differentiate its approach. CPI is more expensive than PET, but has better surface hardness and scratch resistance.\r\n\r\nKolon Industry has apparently emerged as a potential supplier of the material. The company previously built a mass production line for CPI film after anticipating strong demand from upcoming foldable devices. China-based Lens Technology is expected to supply the ultra-thin glass for the foldable ‌iPhone‌ and will handle bonding the final protective film to the glass.\r\n\r\nTouch ID‌, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the \"C2\" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and ‌‌iPhone 18‌‌ Pro Max later this year.\nTags: Foldable iPhone, The Elec\nThis article, \"Apple Hoping to Outdo Rivals With Tougher Display for Foldable iPhone\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "We were so busy covering Apple's earnings call last Thursday that iFixit's AirTag 2 teardown video that afternoon went under our radar until now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who have yet to watch the video, iFixit opens up the AirTag 2 and reveals what is new inside, including a redesigned speaker that is up to 50% louder than the one in the previous AirTag, according to Apple. The teardown also provides a look at the AirTag 2's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip and more.\r\n\r\nThe overall design of the AirTag 2 is similar to the original version of the item tracking accessory.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile a previous teardown showed that it is more difficult to remove the speaker in the AirTag 2, compared to the one in the original AirTag, iFixit was still able to disable the speaker's audible chime with the use of a soldering gun.\r\n\r\nFor those who are not familiar, the AirTag is a small accessory that you can attach to your backpack, keys, or other items. Then, you can track the location of those items in the Find My app on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and iCloud.com.\r\n\r\nreleased the new AirTag last month. In addition to the louder speaker, Precision Finding works up to 50% farther away from an item compared to the previous-generation model, and the overall Bluetooth tracking range is also improved.\r\n\r\nRelated Reading: AirTag 2 Hands-On: What's New and Should You Upgrade?\nRelated Roundup: AirTag\nTags: iFixit, Teardown\nThis article, \"iFixit Shares AirTag 2 Teardown, Here's What's New\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/",
        "description": "Japanese blog Mac Otakara today shared some alleged details about the iPhone 17e and iPad 12, which are both expected to be released within the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 2025, Apple discontinued the iPhone SE and released a new entry-level iPhone 16e. The device features a 6.1-inch OLED display, an A18 chip, Apple Intelligence, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, an Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The iPhone 17e would be the follow-up, spec-bumped model.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report, which cites \"reliable sources,\" the iPhone 17e will have a similar overall design as the iPhone 16e. While some previous rumors indicated that the iPhone 17e would have a Dynamic Island, the report said this information is not true and that the device will continue to have a notch like the iPhone 16e.\r\n\r\nA19 chip: This one is no big surprise, but the iPhone 17e is expected to be powered by Apple's A19 chip, up from the A18 chip in the iPhone 16e. This upgrade will result in faster performance and power efficiency improvements.\n\r\n  \nC1X modem: Apple says its second-generation C1X modem for 5G and LTE is up to twice as fast as its first-generation C1 modem in the iPhone 16e. Apple also says the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone to date.\n\r\nN1 chip: Like the iPhone Air, the report said the iPhone 17e will be equipped with Apple's N1 chip for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Thread. In the iPhone Air, the N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and Apple says the chip improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.\nAs for the iPad 12, the report said that device will likely have a similar design as the iPad 11, but with a newer A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence. That means the iPad 12 would have 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPad 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nA separate report from Macwelt, available in English on Macworld, cites a source who said that Apple plans to announce the iPhone 17e with a press release on an unusual date: Thursday, February 19. The publication agreed that the iPhone 17e will not have a Dynamic Island, but they do expect the device to feature MagSafe, as previously rumored.\n\r\n  \nMagSafe: Unlike the iPhone 16e, the iPhone 17e will reportedly feature MagSafe for up to 20W-25W magnetic wireless charging. The iPhone 16e is limited to Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W speeds. You would also be able to magnetically attach accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wallet to the back of the iPhone 17e.\nMacwelt added that the iPhone 17e will still have a single rear camera.\r\n\r\nApple announced the iPhone 16e on Wednesday, February 19 last year, so the iPhone 17e would be unveiled exactly one year later if this rumor is accurate. It is quite uncommon for Apple to unveil new products on a Thursday, but anything is possible.\r\n\r\nRelated Roundup: iPad\nTags: Mac Otakara, Macwelt, Macworld\nBuyer's Guide: iPad (Don't Buy)\nRelated Forum: iPad\nThis article, \"iPhone 17e and iPad 12 Features and Release Date Rumors Surface in Two New Reports\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

        "description": "Aspiring Starlink competitor Logos Space Services has secured FCC clearance to launch more than  4,000 broadband satellites into low Earth orbit by 2035, as reported by Space News. Under FCC regulations, the company must deploy half of the approved amount within the next seven years.\nThe company is headed by its founder, Milo Medin, a former project manager at NASA as well as a former vice president of wireless services at Google. The company has been raising money since it opened its doors in 2023 and reportedly hopes to deploy its first satellite by 2027. Logos’ planned low Earth orbit constellation would beam high-speed broadband internet to customers worldwide, including government and enterprise users, much like Starlink.\n\nWhile the satellite broadband market is growing, Starlink remains the biggest player by far. The European Space Agency estimates there are just over 14,000 functioning satellites currently in orbit and we know that roughly 9,600 of them are a part of the Starlink constellation. The SpaceX subsidiary recently asked the FCC for clearance to launch a million satellites, though in reality, the FCC will likely trend closer to the 7,500 it approved on the last go-around. The ESA says it expects 100,000 satellites to be in orbit by 2030.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-potential-starlink-competitor-just-got-fcc-clearance-to-launch-4000-satellites-143905076.html?src=rss",

        "link": "https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/ai-for-transformation-how-saps-joule-for-consultants-reimagines-project",
        "description": "Presented by SAP\n\nSAP’s AI solution, Joule, has already transformed how business users work — turning siloed data and tasks into intelligent, connected workflows. But consultants on SAP projects face a different set of needs: navigating complex implementations, evolving best practices, and the pressure to deliver faster. They need timely, expert-level guidance. They need an AI partner that can deliver accurate SAP knowledge in an instant. Enter SAP Joule for Consultants, purpose-built to help system integrators and consulting teams drive smarter, faster outcomes for their clients.\n\"The consultant's focus is not using our business applications — it’s to help implement those systems, perform upgrades, and at the largest scale, help our customers transform their on-premises SAP ERP to SAP Business Suite in the cloud,\" says Victor Alvarez, head of product marketing, Joule, at SAP. \"Acting as a knowledge-grounded AI teammate, SAP Joule for Consultants delivers trusted answers at critical moments, guides design decisions, and keeps projects aligned with SAP’s latest best practices.\"\nIt can both compress timelines and improve project execution at every stage of delivery, resulting in a higher quality of service, he adds. \n\"Our customers want to complete their SAP projects as quickly as possible to realize the value of those initiatives sooner,\" Alvarez says. \"SAP Joule for Consultants puts the most accurate and up-to-date information at the fingertips of the consultants and system integrators performing these projects. It helps consultants decide and act with agility, reduce overall costs, and shorten project timelines without sacrificing quality.\"\nBuilding a better AI teammate\nAI is no longer an option in consulting. It’s reshaping how projects are designed, delivered, and scaled. For SAP consulting practices, this shift is especially pronounced as SAP cloud transformation and implementation projects demand deep knowledge and expertise. AI can help surface knowledge in seconds, making consultants more productive and improving project outcomes. As a result, practice leaders are not considering whether to use AI, but which AI solution to put at the core of their delivery model.\nWhat sets SAP Joule for Consultants apart is its underlying knowledge base. Any AI solution can generate an answer. What matters most is if the answer is accurate and can be trusted to guide project execution. SAP Joule for Consultants is grounded in SAP’s most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date knowledge base. The knowledge base is expertly curated by SAP and includes exclusive content not available to third-party solutions or AI-enabled search engines. \n“We recognized an opportunity to help our partners transform their consulting practices with the most reliable AI assistance available,” Alvarez says. “We’ve leveraged our expertise and vast set of non-public customer enablement content to ground SAP Joule for Consultants with the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy knowledge.” \nFor SAP consultants at every level \nConsultants at all experience levels have traditionally spent enormous time searching for information before they can take the next step — whether it’s making an architectural decision that shapes an entire implementation or solving a specific, tactical issue.\nAll that research time is slashed to an extraordinary degree with SAP Joule for Consultants. By delivering expert-level answers drawn from a continually updated knowledge base, the solution helps consultants keep work moving and make smarter decisions that minimize rework.\n\"If you think about cloud transformation, there’s a huge return on investment,” Alvarez explains. “For SAP customers, this ROI goes beyond traditional cloud benefits to also unlock the AI innovations available in SAP Business Suite. SAP Joule for Consultants is part of our commitment to help our customers reduce time to value and achieve AI impact at scale.\"\nEnabling SAP customers too\nThe solution isn't just for consultants; it’s also for the IT departments within SAP customers. Organizations don’t have the luxury of engaging a consultant for every SAP project — sometimes the work needs to, or can be, done in-house. So, in the same way that SAP Joule for Consultants enables consultants with expert-level knowledge, internal IT teams can benefit from on-demand answers and guidance to accelerate internally staffed projects. \n\"They can use SAP Joule for Consultants to access the knowledge needed to take on more complex projects too,\" Alvarez says. \"That opens up more opportunity to engage system integrators on the more strategic and impactful projects.”\nIT teams also benefit from elevated collaboration with their consulting partners. SAP Joule for Consultants helps bridge knowledge gaps that traditionally limit how much internal staff can contribute to and influence project outcomes.\n\"SAP Joule for Consultants makes customers more informed, so that they can collaborate with their consultant partners in a more impactful way,\" he explains. \"It illuminates the nuances of a project, helping clients ask the right questions and participate more actively in critical project decisions to ensure the best possible project outcomes.\"\nPowerful new features coming soon\nSAP Joule for Consultants has been generally available for almost one year, and the demand from both large firms like KPMG and smaller organizations has been tremendous, Alvarez says — a strong validation of its value proposition. The next major milestone is already on the horizon: partner knowledge integration.\n“Our system integrator partners have institutional knowledge that embodies their industry experience and the best practices that distinguish their services and create predictable project outcomes,” he explains. “Soon, they’ll be able to add that institutional knowledge to their instance of SAP Joule for Consultants — creating a single, unified solution that puts both SAP and firm-specific knowledge at their consultants’ fingertips.”\n\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

        "description": "You will have to wait a bit longer before you can buy a Steam Machine — and you may have to pay more for one, too. Valve had intended to release the console-style SteamOS-powered device in early 2026, and AMD CEO Lisa Su just claimed that the company was on track to start shipping it soon. But in a new post detailing the latest updates for its upcoming Steam products, Valve has revealed that while it’s still aiming to start selling the console in the first half of the year, it has yet to decide on concrete pricing and a launch date for it. The release of Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset and controller will be delayed, as well.\nValve was hoping to be able to announce pricing and launch dates by now. The company cited industry-wide memory and storage shortages, which have grown since the Steam devices’ announcement, as the culprit for the delay. It explained that it has to rethink their exact shipping schedules and pricing due to the limited availability and the rising prices of those components. “We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible,” Valve wrote. As The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the artificial intelligence industry has been hoovering up manufacturers’ available memory chips and hard drives for its infrastructure developments. That has led to shortages for other industries, like PCs and phones. \nThe Steam Machine is a compact cube-like PC for gaming powered by a semi-custom AMD CPU and GPU. Valve said during its announcement that it has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. In the new post, Valve said that majority of Steam titles played great at those settings during testing, though some required more upscaling than others and may fare better when played at a lower framerate to maintain a 1080p resolution. It also revealed that you will have easy access to the Machine’s SSD and memory if you want to upgrade them. Meanwhile, the Steam Frame is a wireless, standalone VR headset that can play both PC and Android games. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html?src=rss",

        "description": "You might have noticed that over the last several years, more and more companies have shifted to a subscription model for their products and services, and Apple has slowly begun to follow suit. As Apple hardware continues to improve, customers are keeping their devices for longer. Meaning that Apple is earning less per customer on their hardware purchases. This has pushed Apple to add more products to its services. Today, Apple offers subscriptions like cloud storage, media, productivity tools, AppleCare, and now products like Creator Studio. This suggests the company is willing to expand subscriptions into areas that were traditionally one-time purchases, a trend that we need to keep a close eye on. The easiest way to see how far Apple has leaned into subscriptions is to simply lay out everything the company currently offers.\nmore…",

        "description": "The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, has prohibited Amazon from continuing its practice of using mechanisms to control the prices charged by sellers on its platform in the country. Germany’s competition regulator explained that the company uses “various price control mechanisms” to review prices set by third-party Markerplace sellers. If the website deems a specific listing’s pricing as too high, it allegedly removes the listing altogether or prevents it from being prominently displayed in the Buy Box section that lets you quickly purchase items. If those listings aren’t removed completely, they’re banished to less prominent sections like in the “See all buying options” and the “Other sellers on Amazon” lists. This reduced visibility could “lead to significant losses in sales” for sellers. \nAmazon was found to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, because the company itself runs its own retail business and sells goods on the platform. That makes third-party sellers, which make up for 60 percent of the items sold on the website, direct competitors. Cartel Office president Andreas Mundt said Amazon must only be allowed to influence competitors’ pricing “in the most exceptional cases,” such as “in the event of excessive pricing.” He didn’t specify what the agency views as “excessive pricing,” but he said allowing the company to continue its current practices will give it the power to “control the price level on the trading platform according to its own ideas.” He also said that Amazon could use its mechanisms “to compete with the rest of the online retail sector outside”of its own website. Amazon’s interference could lead to third-party sellers “no longer being able to cover their own costs, forcing them out of the Marketplace,” he added. \nRocco Bräuniger, Amazon’s country manager for Germany, told Bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling and will continue operating as usual. “Amazon would be the only retailer in Germany forced to highlight non-competitive prices for customers,” he said. ”This makes no sense for customers, sales partners, or competition.” He also asserted that the office’s decision will throttle innovation in the European Union. \nAmazon has been under scrutiny in Europe for years now. Back in 2022, it pledged not to use private sellers’ data to compete with them in the Marketplace in the EU. It also promised to give sellers \"equal treatment” when ranking them in the Buy Box section. \n“The Bundeskartellamt considers this systematic interference in the Marketplace sellers’ freedom to set their own prices to constitute an abuse under the special provisions for large digital companies (Section 19a(2) of the German Competition Act (GWB)) as well as a violation of the general abuse provisions under Section 19 GWB and Article 102 TFEU,” the agency wrote. “…In these proceedings, the Bundeskartellamt has worked closely with the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU Regulation on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act).”\nThe agency is slapping Amazon with a fine due to those violations, but the $70 million penalty it’s asking for is merely partial payment based on the economic benefits the company enjoyed from its alleged anti-competitive behaviors. According to the Bundeskartellamt, the identified antitrust violations are still ongoing, so Amazon may have to pay more. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-germany-fined-70-million-for-influencing-third-party-marketplace-pricing-140000588.html?src=rss",
