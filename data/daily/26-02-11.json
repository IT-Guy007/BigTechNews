      "link": "https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-claude-cowork-finally-lands-on-windows-and-it-wants-to-automate",
      "description": "Anthropic released its Claude Cowork AI agent software for Windows on Monday, bringing the file management and task automation tool to roughly 70 percent of the desktop computing market and intensifying a remarkable corporate realignment that has seen Microsoft embrace a direct competitor to its longtime AI partner, OpenAI.\nThe Windows launch arrives with what Anthropic calls \"full feature parity\" with the macOS version: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors for integrating external services. Users can now also set global and folder-specific instructions that Claude follows in every session, a feature developers on Reddit described as \"a game-changer\" for maintaining context across projects.\n\"Cowork is now available on Windows,\" Anthropic announced on X. \"We're bringing full feature parity with MacOS: file access, multi-step task execution, plugins, and MCP connectors.\"\nThe release closes a critical platform gap that had limited Cowork to Apple's operating system since its January 12 debut. The Windows expansion underscores a broader transformation already underway in enterprise AI, with Microsoft simultaneously selling its own GitHub Copilot to customers while encouraging thousands of its own employees to adopt Anthropic's competing tools internally.\n\nInside Microsoft's surprising pivot toward its biggest AI rival\nThe relationship between Microsoft and Anthropic has accelerated with striking speed. In November, the two companies announced a strategic partnership allowing Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Claude Haiku 4.5. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic committed to purchasing $30 billion of Azure compute capacity.\nBut the partnership has expanded well beyond cloud hosting. According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.\nMicrosoft's CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\n\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.\nThe company's spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.\nA $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its bets\nMicrosoft's embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft's products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI's technology.\nThat relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic's Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic's models have proven more capable than OpenAI's counterparts.\nOn February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic's most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company's enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\n\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"\nThe timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.\nWhy a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its future\nThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork's capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.\nBloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.\nThe fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user's machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.\nAnthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company's Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.\nThe hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your files\nSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company's support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.\nCowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\n\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don't give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"\nThe Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user's personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\n\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.\nMajor corporations are already betting on Claude's enterprise potential\nDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest. Customer testimonials published alongside the Claude Opus 4.6 announcement on the Microsoft Azure blog included statements from Adobe, Dentons, and other major organizations already integrating Anthropic's technology into their workflows.\n\"At Adobe, we're continuously evaluating new AI capabilities that can help us deliver more powerful, responsible, and intuitive experiences for our customers,\" said Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer. \"Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\"\nMatej Jambrich, CTO of Dentons Europe, described deploying Claude for legal work: \"Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.\"\nOn Reddit, an Anthropic representative wrote that the Windows release addresses \"the most consistent request\" since Cowork's macOS debut — a demand that came \"especially from enterprise teams.\" The detail underscores the tool's perceived value in corporate environments where Windows dominates the desktop landscape.\nAt $20 a month, Cowork positions itself as a premium productivity play\nAccess to these capabilities comes at a price. Cowork for Windows is available in research preview at claude.com/cowork for all paid Claude subscription tiers, including Pro ($20/month), Max ($100/month), Team, and Enterprise. Free-tier users cannot access the feature.\nThis pricing structure positions Cowork as a premium productivity tool rather than a mass-market offering — at least for now. Anthropic has not announced plans for broader availability, and the \"research preview\" designation suggests the company continues to gather user feedback before committing to a general release.\nThe January macOS launch was similarly restricted to $100/month Max subscribers before expanding to other paid tiers, suggesting Anthropic may follow a gradual rollout strategy as it refines the product. For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.\nThe battle for the future of work has a new front line\nFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.\nThe company's willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.\nFor the broader software industry, Cowork's expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.\nThe $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork's January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.\nThe software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

According to a January 22 report in The Verge, Microsoft has begun encouraging thousands of employees from some of its most prolific teams to adopt Claude Code — and now, by extension, Cowork — even if they have no coding experience.\nMicrosoft's CoreAI team, the new AI engineering group led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, has tested Claude Code in recent months, The Verge reported. The company has also approved Claude Code across all code and repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.\n\"Software engineers at Microsoft are now expected to use both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot and give feedback comparing the two,\" The Verge reported.\nThe company's spending on Anthropic approaches $500 million annually, according to The Information. Microsoft has even begun counting Anthropic AI model sales toward Azure sales quotas — an unusual incentive structure that the company typically reserves for homegrown products or models from OpenAI.\nA $13 billion partnership faces new questions as Microsoft hedges its bets\nMicrosoft's embrace of Anthropic raises uncomfortable questions about its $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which has long served as the exclusive provider of frontier AI models for Microsoft's products. The two companies signed their landmark partnership in 2019, with Microsoft providing Azure computing infrastructure in exchange for preferential access to OpenAI's technology.\nThat relationship now appears to be evolving into something more nuanced. Microsoft has started favoring Anthropic's Claude models inside Microsoft 365 apps and Copilot recently, deploying them in specific applications or features where Anthropic's models have proven more capable than OpenAI's counterparts.\nOn February 5, Microsoft announced that Claude Opus 4.6 — Anthropic's most advanced model — would become available in Microsoft Foundry, the company's enterprise AI platform. The Azure blog post framed the integration as bringing \"even more capability to agents that increasingly learn from and act on business systems.\"\n\"At Microsoft we believe that intelligence and trust are the core requirements of agentic AI at scale,\" the announcement stated. \"Built on Azure, Microsoft Foundry brings these capabilities together on a secure, scalable cloud foundation for enterprise AI.\"\nThe timing and tone suggest Microsoft views Anthropic not merely as a hedging strategy but as a genuine technical leader in certain domains. Claude Opus 4.6 offers a one-million-token context window and 128,000-token maximum output — specifications that position it for complex, long-running enterprise tasks that require processing vast amounts of information.\nWhy a $285 billion stock selloff has the software industry questioning its future\nThe deepening Microsoft-Anthropic alliance takes on added significance when viewed against a backdrop of genuine alarm rippling through the software industry. Within days of the macOS launch in January, investors began repricing SaaS companies whose products overlap with Cowork's capabilities — project management tools, writing assistants, data analysis platforms, and workflow automation software all saw sharp declines.\nBloomberg reported that Cowork triggered a $285 billion software stocks selloff. The carnage reflected growing investor conviction that AI agents capable of automating knowledge work could render entire categories of enterprise software obsolete.\nThe fear is not abstract. Cowork operates as a desktop agent powered by Claude Opus 4.6 that can read local files, execute multi-step tasks, and interact with external services through plugins — all running directly on a user's machine. Unlike chatbot interfaces that respond to individual prompts, Cowork plans and executes complete workflows across files, applications, and connected services.\nAnthropic has leaned into this positioning. On January 30, the company's Anthropic Labs division released 11 open-source agentic plugins spanning sales, legal, finance, marketing, data analysis, and software development. These plugins connect Cowork to external tools, enabling the agent to pull data from CRMs, draft legal documents, analyze spreadsheets, or manage project boards without users switching applications.\nThe hidden risks of giving an AI agent access to your files\nSuch convenience comes with tradeoffs, and Anthropic has been transparent about the risks inherent in agent software that can read, write, and delete files. The company's support documentation warns users to \"be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records\" and suggests saving backups and creating dedicated folders with nonsensitive information.\nCowork remains susceptible to prompt injection attacks — hidden instructions embedded in documents or websites that can hijack AI agents and redirect their actions. The browser automation feature includes an explicit disclaimer warning that hidden code in websites may \"steal your data, inject malware into your systems, or take over your system.\"\n\"We use a virtual machine under the hood,\" Boris Cherny, Anthropic's head of Claude Code, told Wired. \"This means you have to say which folders Claude has access to. And if you don't give it access to a folder, Claude literally cannot see that folder.\"\nThe Windows version includes additional safety constraints. According to user reports on Reddit, Cowork on Windows restricts file access to the user's personal folder, preventing the agent from accessing common development directories like C:\\git. While some users expressed frustration at this limitation, others noted it as a prudent safeguard for less technical users.\n\"To be fair, seeing how many people nuked themselves with Claude Code, it is much safer to limit people to reduce the collateral damage,\" wrote one Reddit user.\nMajor corporations are already betting on Claude's enterprise potential\nDespite the security caveats, early enterprise adoption suggests meaningful interest. Customer testimonials published alongside the Claude Opus 4.6 announcement on the Microsoft Azure blog included statements from Adobe, Dentons, and other major organizations already integrating Anthropic's technology into their workflows.\n\"At Adobe, we're continuously evaluating new AI capabilities that can help us deliver more powerful, responsible, and intuitive experiences for our customers,\" said Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer. \"Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\"\nMatej Jambrich, CTO of Dentons Europe, described deploying Claude for legal work: \"Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.\"\nOn Reddit, an Anthropic representative wrote that the Windows release addresses \"the most consistent request\" since Cowork's macOS debut — a demand that came \"especially from enterprise teams.\" The detail underscores the tool's perceived value in corporate environments where Windows dominates the desktop landscape.\nAt $20 a month, Cowork positions itself as a premium productivity play\nAccess to these capabilities comes at a price. Cowork for Windows is available in research preview at claude.com/cowork for all paid Claude subscription tiers, including Pro ($20/month), Max ($100/month), Team, and Enterprise. Free-tier users cannot access the feature.\nThis pricing structure positions Cowork as a premium productivity tool rather than a mass-market offering — at least for now. Anthropic has not announced plans for broader availability, and the \"research preview\" designation suggests the company continues to gather user feedback before committing to a general release.\nThe January macOS launch was similarly restricted to $100/month Max subscribers before expanding to other paid tiers, suggesting Anthropic may follow a gradual rollout strategy as it refines the product. For enterprise customers evaluating the tool, the pricing represents a fraction of what many pay for traditional software licenses—a calculus that could accelerate adoption if Cowork delivers on its automation promises.\nThe battle for the future of work has a new front line\nFor Microsoft, the deepening Anthropic partnership reflects a pragmatic recognition that AI leadership may require embracing multiple frontier providers rather than relying exclusively on a single partner.\nThe company's willingness to deploy Claude tools internally while selling GitHub Copilot externally suggests confidence that the enterprise market can accommodate competing approaches — or perhaps an acknowledgment that betting everything on OpenAI carries its own risks.\nFor the broader software industry, Cowork's expansion to Windows extends the competitive threat to an even larger installed base. Companies whose value propositions rest on task automation, file management, or workflow orchestration now face a well-funded competitor capable of replicating their core functionality through natural language commands.\nThe $285 billion in market capitalization that evaporated after Cowork's January launch may prove to be just an opening salvo. With Windows support now live, Anthropic has removed the last major platform barrier between its AI agent and the enterprise customers most likely to adopt it.\nThe software industry spent decades building tools to help knowledge workers manage files, automate tasks, and organize information. Now it faces a future where a single application, powered by an AI that learns and improves with every interaction, threatens to do all of that and more. The question is no longer whether AI agents will reshape enterprise software, but how much of the old world will survive the transformation.",

        "description": "Amazon has announced that it will bring its same-day prescription delivery service to 4,500 new cities and towns by the end of 2026. The company originally launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 with a two-day delivery option, and has continued to increase the availability and delivery speed of the service in the years that followed, including expanding access to nearly half of all US residents in 2024.\nThe company's announcement doesn't break down all the new cities same-day deliveries will be available in, but does note that the delivery option is coming to Idaho and Massachusetts for the first time. In the past, access to same-day deliveries has been determined by where Amazon has fulfillment centers that it can open pharmacies in. Amazon Pharmacy also offers next-day delivery and in some cities, the ability to pick up prescriptions from Amazon's OneMedical offices.\nAmazon reportedly applied for Amazon Pharmacy trademarks in the UK, Canada and Australia in 2020, but has yet to expand its prescription delivery service to those regions. In 2023, Amazon launched RxPass, a separate $5 per month subscription that lets Amazon Prime customers order from a collection over 50 common medications for a flat fee. Amazon began letting Medicare recipients access the subscription in 2024.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazons-same-day-prescription-deliveries-are-coming-to-even-more-cities-192221224.html?src=rss",

Consider this a minor update that focuses primarily on bug fixes, which is important but not exactly fun. It is worth noting that the new iOS and iPadOS has an especially long list of fixes. There are 37 security issues addressed by the update, according to a report by 9to5Mac. \n\niOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 do include a new tool for transitioning from an Apple device to an Android device, which is handy. It transfers photos, notes, messages, apps and other data to an Android phone but doesn't do anything with health data, protected notes or photos. There's also a new option to forward notifications from an iPhone or iPad to another device, but only for users in the EU. \nThe update to macOS Tahoe 26.3 is just bug fixes and security enhancements. The same goes for watchOS 26.3.\nWhy the small fries update? Rumors have been swirling that Apple is saving the big guns for the next release. Insiders have suggested that software update 26.4 will include the long-awaited Siri refresh and new emoji functionality.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-released-ios-263-alongside-updates-for-the-mac-ipad-and-apple-watch-193532483.html?src=rss",

        "description": "Threads users have been complaining about its recommendation algorithm pretty much since the beginning of the platform. At some point, this turned into a meme, with users writing posts jokingly addressed to the algorithm in which they requested to see more posts about the topics they're actually interested in.\nNow, Meta is turning those \"Dear algorithm\" posts into an official feature that it says will allow Threads users to tune their recommendations in real time. With the change, users can write a post that begins with \"dear algo\" to adjust their preferences. For example, you could write \"dear algo, show me more posts about cute cats.\" You can also ask to see fewer posts about topics you don't want to see, like \"dear algo, stop showing me posts about sick pets.\"\nYou can track your requests to the algorithm in the app's settings in order to revisit them or remove them. You can also retweet other users' \"dear algo\" posts to have those topics reflected in your feed. Importantly, \"dear algo\" requests are temporary and only last for three days at a time, which Meta says is meant to keep the algorithm feel fresher and more flexible.  \nThe rollout of the feature follows a limited test late last year. Now, \"dear algo\" posts will work for Threads users in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand with more countries coming \"soon.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-turned-threads-algorithm-complaints-into-an-official-feature-180000236.html?src=rss",

        "description": "The U.S. version of TikTok is being updated with a new community-focused \"Local Feed,\" according to a blog post shared by the TikTok USDS Joint Venture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Local Feed is designed to let TikTok users \"discover and connect with content, businesses, and services\" wherever they are. Available from a tab on the TikTok home screen, the feed features content related to travel, events, restaurants, and shopping, plus posts from nearby small businesses and local creators.\r\n\r\nTikTok U.S. says that posts are selected based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted. TikTok users who want access to the Local Feed will need to turn on precise location.\r\n\r\n\"This approach is consistent with how many modern apps use location today and gives people the choice to enable it when they want more relevant, local experiences, while keeping them in control,\" reads the blog post.\r\n\r\nPrecise Location is off by default, and the feature is opt-in with location only relayed when the app is in active use. Location data is \"protected in the TikTok USDS JV secure environment.\"\r\n\r\nTikTok U.S. says that it wants to \"make sure TikTok is useful, locally relevant, and trusted.\" A similar \"Nearby Feeds\" feature rolled out for TikTok users in Europe back in December.\r\n\r\nin late January, and the transition hasn't gone smoothly. TikTok users were unable to upload videos and had posts flagged as ineligible for recommendation, an issue that U.S. TikTok said was due to a power outage at a data center.\r\n\r\nTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is 80.1 percent owned by U.S. and global investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The three companies each own 15 percent as managing investors, and other U.S. stakeholders include the Dell Family Office and affiliates of Susquehanna International Group. TikTok parent company ByteDance continues to hold a 19.9 percent stake.\r\n\r\nA seven-member majority-American board of directors is operating the U.S. version of TikTok, with Adam Presser, TikTok's former global head of operations serving as CEO.\r\n\r\nTag: TikTok\nThis article, \"U.S. TikTok Introduces 'Local Feed' to Surface Nearby Events and Content\" first appeared on MacRumors.com\nDiscuss this article in our forums",
